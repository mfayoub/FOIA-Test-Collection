D0			Marriage Penalties and Bonuses, and Stay-At-Home Parents
D0			Overview
D0			    • These are overlapping, but distinct, issues. Marriage penalties and bonuses affect most married couples as well as many currently urunarried individuals. The tax treatment of marriage is a very broad issue.
D0			The concern about the child care costs of stay-at-home parents is a narrower issue of primary concern to couples with young children.
D0			    • This memo has three sections: The first describes marriage penalties, why they arise, and provides examples. The second describes and analyses options for reducing marriage penalties. The third describes and analyses a few additional options specifically aimed at stay­ at-home parents.
D0			    I. What Are Marriage Penalties?
D0			        ◦ A couple that owes more income tax by filing a joint return than they would pay if they were unmarried and each filed separate returns has a marriage penalty.
D0			        ◦ Conversely, a couple that_owes less income tax by filing a joint return than they would pay if they were unmarried and each filed separate returns has a marriage bonus.
D0			        ◦ In general, couples with a stay-at-home spouse receive marriage bonuses, whereas two­ earner couples in which spouses have similar earnings face marriage penalties.
D0			Why Do Marriage Penalties and Bonuses Arise?
D0			        ◦ Marriage penalties and bonuses generally arise because the standard deduction and rate brackets for joint filers are less than twice the corresponding amounts for single filers.
D0			        ◦ For couples with children, marriage penalties may arise because a spouse could file as a head of household ifthe couple were not married.
D0			The head of household standard deduction and rates are more generous than corresponding amounts for single filers. -2-
D0			    • Marriage penalties and bonuses also arise because of other tax provisions, such as the EITC, the taxation of Social Security benefits, and the AMT exemption for which the parameters for joint filers are less than twice the corresponding amounts for single filers.
D0			Examples
D0			    • Consider four couples, each with $60,000 of earnings (and no other income). Couples A and B have no children, Couples C and D each have one child. Couples A and C have two earners, each with $30,000 of earnings. Couples B and D have one earner with $60,000 of earnings.
D0			    • The details of the tax computations for these couples are shown in the attachment.
D0			    • In summary, here is what the examples show: Two-earner Couples A and C have marriage penalties, whereas one-earner couples B and D have marriage bonuses. The marriage penalties and bonuses for the couples with a child are smaller than for the couples without a child. However, this would not be true in all circumstances. Having a child reduces Couple C's and D's tax liability significantly relative to Couples A and B, because of the additional exemption for the child, the child credit, and (for Couple C) the child and dependent care tax credit (CDCTC).
D0			How Large Are Aggregate Marriage Penalties and Bonuses?
D0			    • There are approximately $30 billion per year of marriage penalties and $34 billion per year of marriage bonuses according to a recent CBO study.
D0			    • More taxpayers have bonuses than penalties, with marriage boriuses predominating for low income families, and marriage penalties predominating for high income families, especially when there are two high earners.
D1			    II. Options for Addressing Marriage Penalties
D1			Five options for addressing marriage penalties have been discussed: a single filer option, an income splitting option, making joint tax parameters double single parameters, a two-earner deduction, and a targeted two-earner deduction or credit.
D1			        ◦ Treasury is doing more analytical work on these options.
D1			Single Filer Option (H.R. 2456 with 2 I 8 cosponsors)
D1			        ◦ Under this option, a married couple could continue to file a joint tax return, or could elect to file two separate returns, as if each were an unmarried individual.
D1			H.R. 2456 would combine separate filing on one tax return form and lessen some of the inherent complexity of separate filing by arbitrarily prorating deductions and by retaining a joint computation of the EITC and other credits.
D1			Each spouse would report their own earnings, but could reallocate their unearned income by shifting assets.
D1			Dependent exemptions would be allocated in proportion to each spouse's share of their total income (AG!).
D1			        ◦ As the examples illustrate, optional single filing would significantly reduce marriage penalties. In the examples marriage bonuses are unaffected, but in some circumstances marriage bonuses would be increased.
D1			        ◦ The examples also illustrate that married couples with identical total incomes and taxes under current law could pay quite different taxes under optional single filing (compare Couples A and B).
D1			        ◦ This option would-be very expensive, costing roughly $22 billion (in 1999 income levels) per year
D1			        ◦ This option would provide only limited or even no tax benefit to stay-at-home parents, since each spouse would report their own earned income.
D1			        ◦ Optional single filing would also substantially increase the burdens of the income tax system.  Many, if not most, married couples would have to make three, rather than one, tax computation (joint, his, and hers) in order to determine the filing method that results in the least tax liability.
D1			Currently, couples who pool their resources need not keep separate records by spouse. Under optional separate filing, separate income and deduction records could be necessary and complex rules would be needed to allocate income, deductions, credits and exemptions. -4-
D1			Income Splitting
D1			"A number of Republicans who originally supported H.R. 2456 are now advocating an even more costly approach, which would allow single filing combined with ""income splitting."" The motivation for this option is specifically to provide tax benefits to stay-at-home parents. (Senator Ashcroft's proposal includes this provision.) Under income splitting, half of a couple's income, including their earnings, would be attributed to each spouse."
D1			        ◦ As the examples illustrate, this option would allow two-earner couples to compute their tax as if they were single individuals, reducing their marriage penalties, as under the single filing option. Some two-earner couples would receive a larger tax cut (and reduction in marriage penalties) under income splitting, however, because both earned and unearned income could be split.
D1			        ◦ Income splitting would greatly increase marriage bonuses.
D1			        ◦ This option would cost roughly $36 billion (in 1999 income levels) per year.
D1			        ◦ Income splitting would add computational complexity to income tax filing, although it would not be as onerous as single filing since income would simply be split irrespective of which spouse earned the income or owned the underlying asset.
D1			Make Joint Tax Parameters Double Single Parameters
D1			Marriage penalties could be substantially reduced by making the standard deduction and rate brackets for joint filers twice the corresponding amounts for single filers.
D1			        ◦ One approach would be to increase the joint parameters to twice the current single parameters.
D1			        ◦ As illustrated by the examples, this option is basically equivalent in effect to income splitting, so would be just as expensive ($36 billion per year), and have the same effect on marriage penalties and bonuses.
D1			        ◦ However, this option would be much simpler than income splitting, since no additional computations would be required.
D1			        ◦ An alternative approach would be to reduce the single parameters to half the current joint parameters.
D1			This approach would raise revenue by increasing taxes on most single filers, without reducing taxes paid by married couples.
D1			        ◦ The Treasury reform option adopts an intermediate approach to addressing marriage -5- penalties, but also makes several other significant changes to the tax code.
D1			Tackling marriage penalties as part of a broader reform package ameliorates the stark tradeoff between two-earner couples and single taxpayers that a low-cost marriage penalty solution along these lines would require.
D0			Two-Earner Deduction (H.R. 2593, sponsored by twenty-two mostly Republican Ways and Means Committee members)
D0			This proposal would resurrect the second earner deduction that existed between 1982 and 1986. The deduction is for 10 percent of the first $30,000 of the earnings of the spouse with lesser amount of earnings.
D1			        ◦ As the examples illustrate, this option can reduce marriage penalties significantly.
D1			        ◦ This option can also increase the marriage bonuses of those already receiving marriage bonuses, or change current marriage penalties into marriage bonuses
D1			        ◦ However, this option provides no tax benefits to stay-at-home parents.
D1			        ◦ Our very preliminary revenue estimates are that this proposal would cost approximately $12 billion per year.   ·
D1			A Targeted Two-Earner Deduction or Credit (A less expensive two-earner deduction)
D1			Better targeting of a second earner deduction can be achieved by setting a percentage floor, say, 20 percent, of combined total income (not only earnings) on the second earner deduction. A tax deduction or credit could then be provided for some percentage of the amount by which the earnings of the lower-earning spouse exceed 20 percent of the couple's total income. The size of the deduction or credit can be capped, if there is a resource constraint.
D1			"        ◦ Compared with a simple second earner deduction, very little of the benefits of a targeted deduction or credit are ""wasted"" on those already receiving marriage bonuses."
D1			        ◦ As with the previous proposal, limited deductions (or credits) address the problem by providing only incomplete relief to those with very large penalties.
D1			.         ◦ One variant we have examined costs roughly $5 billion per year, though this cost could be dialed up or down depending on revenue targets.
D1			Ill. Options for Helping Stay-At-Home Parents
D1			Two options specifically designed to help stay-at-home parents have been discussed: -6- extending the CDCTC to stay-at-home parents, and providing an additional child credit for young children. Before describing and analyzing these proposals, the President's Budget proposal to expand the child and dependent care tax credit (CDCTC) is described.
D0			President's Proposal to Expand the CDCTC
D0			        ◦ Under the President's Budget proposal, the credit rate would be raised to 50 percent for parents with incomes (AG!s) of$30,000 or less. This rate would phase down by one percentage point for each $1,000 of income above $30,000 until it reached 20 percent for parents with over $59,000 of income.
D0			The President's proposal retains the requirement that both parents (the parent, in single-parent households) must work (or attend school or be fully disabled) in order to be eligible for the CDCTC.
D0			The President's proposal (including a simplification provision) would cost $5.1 billion over five yea rs.
D0			        ◦ Under this proposal, couples with incomes over $59,000 would have the same CDCTC as under current law.
D0			        ◦ However, because the credit rate is increased for incomes below $59,000, some couples would have larger marriage penalties under the President's proposal than under current law.
D0			        ◦ The President's proposal provides no tax benefits to stay-at-home parents.
D0			Extend the CDCTC to Stay-At-Home Parents
D0			        ◦ Senator Chafee has introduced a bill that would deem taxpayers with one or more children under the age of four to have incurred child care expenses of $150 per month ($1,800 per year) for purposes of the CDCTC.
D0			As under the President's proposal, the credit rate would be raised to 50 percent for parents with incomes (AG!s) of $30,000 or less.
D0			However, the 50% rate would phase down more slowly under the Chafee proposal, by one percentage point for each $1,500 of income above $30,000, until it completely phased out.
D0			        ◦ Under the Chafee proposal, couples with a stay-at-home parent could receive a CDCTC.
D0			        ◦ However, many single parents and two-earner couples with children under the age of four would also benefit from the Senator Chafee's proposal, either because they work but do -7- not pay for child care, or pay for child care but do not claim as much credit as they would be eligible for under the proposal.
D1			o   We have prepared preliminary revenue estimates for two variants of the Chafee proposal.
D1			Both variants differ from the Chafee proposal in two respects: they would apply to children under·age three (rather than age four), and both would deem minimum expenses on a per-child basis (up to two or more children).
D1			One variant would allow parents of children under the age of three to claim a deemed amount of annual child care expenses of $1,200 ($2,400 for two or more children under age three) plus actual child care expenses, up to the current law limit of $2,400 ($4,800 for two or more eligible children) for purposes of the CDCTC.
D1			This variant would cost $13.4 billion over five years ($8.5 billion more than the President's Budget proposal).
D1			A second variant would allow parents of children under the age of three to claim a deemed amount of annual child care expense of $1,200 ($2,400 for two or more children under age three), or, if more, actual child care expenses (up to the current law limit of $2,400 ($4,800 for two or more eligible children)) for purpose of the CDCTC. It would also phase the credit out at $103,500 of AGL
D1			This second variant would cost $11.4 billion over five years ($6.5 billion more than the President's Budget proposal).
D1			Provide an Additional Child Credit for Young Children
D1			o       The child credit could be increased for young children, irrespective of the work status or out-of-pocket child care expenses of the parent(s).
D1			For example, the child credit could be doubled for children under the age of one. This would make the credit for these children $1,000 beginning in 1999. This option would cost roughly $4 billion over five years.
T0			Attachment
D0			Examples of Marriage Penalties and Bonuses
D0			Measuring Marriage Penalties and Bonuses
D0			For purposes of measuring marriage penalties and bonuses, it is assumed that if a couple were unmarried each spouse would retain their earnings and would each file a separate return.
D0			If the couple has no children, the separate returns would be filed using the standard deduction and rates for single taxpayers.
D0			If the couple has one or more children, it is assumed that the spouse with higher earnings would provide a home for the child(ren) and file using the standard deduction and rates for head of household taxpayers. The other spouse would file as a single taxpayer.
D0			Couple A (Two-Earners. No Children)
D0			    • Two earners, each with $30,000 of earnings, and no other income.
D0			    • No children.

D0			o   Couple A has a marriage penalty of$879.50. If they were unmarried and each spouse filed a separate return, their combined tax liability would be $3,457.50 + $3,457.50 = $6,915.00 which is $879.50 )lli than their tax on a joint return ($7,794.50- $6,915.00 = $879.50). -2-
D0			Couple B {One Earner, No Children)

D0			    • Couple B has a marriage bonus of$3.764.00. If they were unmarried, Spouse 2 would have no tax liability, but Spouse 1 would pay $11,558.50 which is $3,764.00 more than their tax on a joint return ($7,794.50). Note that Couple B pays the same amount of tax as Couple A.
D0			Couple C {Two-Earners. One Child)
D0			    • Two earners, each with $30,000 of earnings, and no other income.
D0			    • One child, and child care expenses of $200 per month ($2,400 per year).
D0			Filing  Filing Separate Returns Joint Return Spouse  I HH Eiler Spouse 2 Single Filer Total Earnings $60,000 $30,000 $30,000 Standard Deduction 7,100 6,250 4,250 Exemptions 8,100 5,400 2,700 Taxable Income 44,800 18,350 23,050 Tax (before credits)    7,038.50    2,752.50    3,457.50 Child Credit (1998) 400.00  400.00  0
D0			    • Couple C has a marriage penalty of $828.50.  If  they were unmarried  and  Spouse  1  filed as a head of household and Spouse 2 filed as single, their combined tax liability would be $5,330.00 (= $1,872.50 + $3,457.50), which is $828.50 less than their tax on a joint return ($6, I 58.50 • $5,330.00 = $828.50).
D0			    • Couple C's marriage penalty is $51 less than if they did not have a child (Couple A).
D0			    Some couples, however, face larger marriage penalties with a child than without.
D0			    • Although Couple C still faces a marriage penalty, having a child reduces their joint return tax liability by $ I,636.00.
D0			The additional exemption for the child has a tax value of $756.00, since Couple C is in the 28% bracket (28% x $2,700 = $756.00).
D0			The child-related credits reduce Couple C's tax liability by $880.00.
D0			Couple D (One Earner, One Child)
D0			    • One earner with $60,000 of earnings, other spouse is stay-at-home, no other income.
D0			    • One child.

D0			    • Couple D has a marriage bonus of $2,086.00. If they were unmarried and Spouse I filed as a head of household (Spouse 2 would not have to file a return), their combined tax liability would be $8,724.50, which is $2,086.00 more than their tax on a joint return ($8,724.50 - $6,638.50 = $2,086.00). • -4-
D0			        ◦ Couple D's marriage bonus is $1,678.00 less than if they did not have a child (Couple B).
D0			This is because if Couple D had no children, filing separately would require Spouse I to file as single, which has a less favorable standard deduction and rates than for a head of household.
D0			        ◦ Although Couple D has a smaller marriage bonus than if they were childless, having a child reduces their joint return tax liability by $1,156.00 ($756.00 for the additional exemption and $400.00 for the child credit).
D0			        ◦ The difference in Couple C's and Couple D's joint return liability ($480.00) is due entirely to the CDCTC.
D1			Examples of Proposals to Address Marriage Penalties
D1			Single Filer Option
D1			        ◦ Under this option, a married couple could continue to file a joint tax return, or could elect to file two separate returns, as if each were an unmarried individual.
D1			Each spouse would report their own earnings.
D1			This option would change marriage penalties and bonuses as follows:     Childless Couples    Couples with One Child Couple A (Two Earners) Couple B (One Earner) Couple C (Two Earners) Couple D (One Earner) Current Penalties (Bonuses) $879.50 ($3,764.00) $828.50 ($2,086.00) Option Penalties (Bonuses) 0 ($3,764.00) 300.00 ($2,086.00) Change -879.50 0 -528.50 0
D1			        ◦ The option would eliminate Couple A's marriage penalty and reduce, but not eliminate Couple C's marriage penalty (because the option would not allow any spouse to compute their tax using the head of household standard deduction and rates).
D1			Income Splitting
D1			        ◦ This option would allow separate filing, as in the preceding option, but in addition would attribute half of a couple's total earned income to be attributed to each spouse. • -5-
D1			    • This option would change marriage penalties and bonuses as follows:     Childless Couples           Couples with One Child   Couple A (Two Earners) Couple B (One Earner) Couple C (Two Earners) Couple D (One Earner) Current Penalties (Bonuses) $879.50 ($3,764.00) $828.50 ($2,086.00) Option Penalties (Bonuses) 0 ($4,643.50) 300.00 ($2,614.50) Change -879.50 +879.50 -528.50 +528.50
D1			Make Joint Tax Parameters Double Single Parameters

T0			ASSISTANT SECRETARY DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY WASHINGTON January  30,  l 998
T0			MEMORANDUM FOR SECRETARY RUBrN
T0			FROM:   DONALD C. LUBICK ACTrNG ASSISTANT SECRETARY (TAX POLICY)
D0			SUBJECT:    Agenda for Your Monday Meeting With Chief of Staff Bowles
D1			Your meeting Monday afternoon with Erskine Bowles is to discuss tax legislative strategy: how  to move forward the Administration's proposals and defeat the Congressional proposals. A suggested agenda for the meeting, listing the key issues, is attached. This memorandum provides brief comments on each of those issues. ·
D1			    1. Congressional proposal to sunset the tax code. Administration strategy options:
D1			    • (a) Oppose. The proposal would create great uncertainty, thus likely inhibit business investment until an alternative tax system were enacted, adversely affecting the economy.
D1			"    • (b) Develop an alternative proposal to sunset only upon enactment, without gap, of a replacement tax system that is fair, promotes economic growth, provides the revenue needed to maintain budgetary discipline, and simplifies the tax system for average Americans. This will require that the Congress develop a better system than the current one before it can be. repealed. This will allow members who don't think a better system can be adopted by the Congress to vote for sunset. An alternative approach is to require the sunset proposal to include a number of""poison pills"" (such as retaining home mortgage interest deduction, charitable deduction, etc.), or possibly linking to increase in minimum wage or campaign finance reform. Both of these approaches will also generate uncertainty (but because a shift in the tax system will be perceived as less likely, the adverse impact on the economy would be less severe)."
D1			    • (c) Develop an alternative proposal for rerum-free filing or other major simplification of the present tax system (apparently House Democrats are exploring such options). A return-free systems raise many administrative problems (such as how to handle two­ earner couples, how to provide EITC, etc.) and either places additional burden on IRS when it is facing other problems (reorganization, year 2000 problem, etc.) or places additional burden on employers, or both.
D1			    2. Our strategy for enactment of our initiatives:
D1			    • (a) Micro strategy:  move individual  bills, possibly on one of pending  revenue measures in Senate (Coverdell, technical corrections, line-item veto substitutes, or, less probably, IRS restrucruri.ng). This approach requires Administration acceptance of the (possibly modified) Congressional bill (which is most troublesome in the case of the Coverdell bill. which provides tax credits for sending children to private schools) and offers the opportunity for a major Congressional tax bill.
D1			(b) Budget reconciliaton. (Alan Cohen will supply material)
D1			    3. Congressional initiatives:
D1			    • (a) Marriage penalties. This is a sympathetic issue, but is costly ($29 billion is one measure of penalties) and administratively complex to completely solve, though less costly targeted options providing limited relief can be designed.
D1			"Tax incentives for ""stay-home moms"". This issue has been raised in response to the Administration's proposal to expand the child and dependent tax credit. This will bias the tax system even more strongly against working mothers (who need the credit to offset actual out-of-pocket expenses), while defining ""stay-at-home moms"" in an administratively acceptable manner will be very difficult."
D1			    • (b) Estate tax repeal. TRA 97 provided significant immediate relief to owners of businesses, but provided a lengthy schedule (through 2006) for an increase in the estate tax deduction from $600,000 to $1 million, which might be accelerated if necessary to retain the estate tax (which is needed as backstop to income ta.x);
D1			    • (c) Flat Tax or National Sales Tax. These proposals have strong advocates (who greatly overstate resulting benefits of simplicity and economic growth), but as proposed have many problems, including failure to provide adequate revenue and failure to provide adequate transition relief while significantly shifting burden of tax from high-income taxpayers to others.
D1			    • (d) Cap tax revenues as a fixed percent of GDP. This proposal may have superficial appeal, but could set the stage for runaway deficits and an increase in Federal mandates on States and local governments in lieu of Federal programs. It might best be fought by getting out the correct facts (average tax rates on most families have gone down, actual tax/GDP ratio is much lower than suggested, etc.).
D1			"    • (e) Coverdell. This proposal, which provides tax credits to parents for the cost of their children's private elementary and secondary education, could erode support for high quality public education and will disproportionately favor higher-income families, who are far more able to afford private schooling for their children (even with the tax credit). To somewhat mask the unfairness, the proposal would also cover ""supplemental educational expenses"", which are ill-defined, will thus generate administrative difficulties, and will do little to reduce the bias in favor of higher-income families."
D1			    • (f) IRS restructuring. The House bill meets most of our concerns, and is preferable to earlier (Kerrey-Portrnan) versions and to Roth's likely proposals. The only negatives in the House bill concern inadequate personnel flexibilities and burden of proof and accountant-client privilege issues.
D1			    • (g) Deduction for payroll taxes. This proposal is very expensive (about $65 billion annually), and would disproportionately benefit high-income ta.xpayers (both because they have adequate ta.xable income against which the deduction may be offset, and because of the higher-ta.x rate to which the income being shielded would otherwise have been subject).
D1			Process for Enacting the President's Targeted Tax Cuts This Year
D1			The process for enacting one or many of the President's targeted tax cuts this year comes down to a question of what the possible tax vehicles are this year. There are a number of possibilities:
D1			    1. Reconciliation. The Budget Resolution could call for a reconciliation bill. Reconciling any paid-for tax cuts is dangerous because the reconciliation bill could also be used as a vehicle for tax cuts that use up some or all of the surpluses -- although if tax cuts that are not paid for are included, they should subject this year's Budget Resolution to a 60-vote point-of-order in the Senate. Nonetheless, to protect against reconciliation becoming a vehicle for big tax cuts, we should consider opposing having any reconciliation bill at all this year.
D1			    2. Tax bills that are already in the Senate. There are several tax bills that have already come over to the Senate from the House. This is important because, of course, a new tax bill cannot originate in the Senate. The bills that have already come over include  technical corrections, the Coverdell bill, and one or two bills that undo the line-item veto of certain tax provisions in the last tax bill. These bills could be amended in the Finance Committee or on the floor to include some or all of the President's targeted tax cuts, and then be sent back to the House for conference. Keep in mind that such a tax bill would  not have the protections ofreconciliation on the floor e.g. non-germane amendments can be added. This could be helpful in adding provisions we like, but it could be harmful if provisions we don't like are added or if the bill gets bogged down with a lot of controversial amendments.
D1			    3. New tax bills originating in the House. Chairman Archer may try to move a bill with provisions that reduce revenues as a percentage of GDP. Most likely, these would be mostly provisions which we don't like. Once again, if this bill got to the Senate floor, it would not have the protections ofreconciliation. Democrats could bottle it up there.
D1			There are two bills that Chairman Archer may consider must-pass this year, however. One is an extenders bill. This would be a good bill to which to try to attach the President's tax cuts.
D1			Second, if there is a tobacco settlement bill, it will have some tax components -- aside from the payments required of the tobacco companies. For example, the tax treatment of such payments would have clarified in legislation.· Thus a tobacco settlement bill could include a tax section to which other tax-related  provisions could  be attached.  The tobacco settlement bill-- IF IT MOVES, AND THAT IS A BIG IF --could be an ideal vehicle for targeted tax _cuts because we are already advocating using the tobacco settlement to pay for a number of popular spending  initiatives. Thus the bill could  develop an omnibus character with something for everyone.

D0			President Clinton's Child Tax Credit A Fact Sheet July JO, 1997
D0			The President's child tax credit includes the following features:
D0			Age:     • Covers children under 17 through 2002.     • After 2002, covers children under 19.
D0			Amount per-child:     • $400 in 1998     • $500 in 1999 and then indexed for inflation.
D0			Income Limits:     • Phased out for families with incomes between $60,000 and $75,000 until 2000.     • After 2000, the phase-out range is raised to between $80,000 and $100,000 and then indexed for inflation.
D0			Refundability to Cover Out-of-Pocket Income and Payroll Taxes:     • Working families who pay out of pocket federal taxes would benefit from the child tax credit. The child tax credit is calculated before the EITC and will be partially refundable. A family will get a child credit for their income taxes plus the extent to which their out­ of-pocket (employee share) payroll taxes exceed their EITC.
D0			Savings Incentive Feature:     • Taxpayers who are entitled to a child credit would have the opportunity to contribute their child tax credit plus an additional $500 per-child each year to a Kidsave Account for the child's education, first time home purchase, or the taxpayer's retirement. Earnings would accumulate tax-free in the account and no taxes would be due upon withdrawal for these purposes.
D0			Cost:     • $70.2 billion over 1997-2002.     • $176.l billion over 1997-2007.     • $22.0 billion in 2007.
D0			Working Families Who Pay Taxes and Play by the Rules Deserve a Tax Cut Too
D0			Compared to the President's proposal, the Senate bill denies the child credit to 3.8 million families who make Jess than $30,000. The House bill denies the child tax credit to 4.8 million of these families. The President strongly believes families who work hard, pay taxes, and play by the rules deserve a tax cut too.
D0			Examples of working families who receive a tax cut under President Clinton's plan but are shortchanged by Congressional plans:
D0			Example #1: A Family Like Police Officer Daniel Mercado's Consider a family like Police Officer Daniel Mercado's of Savannah, Georgia. A family like his with two parents, four children, and an income of$26,000 would receive a $1,238 child tax credit under President Clinton's proposal, but would not receive a child tax credit under the House or Senate bills.
D0			Federal Tax Situation Before Any Child Tax Credit/I: Income taxes owed before EITC Payroll taxes Gust employee share) Excise taxes/2 Federal out-of-pocket taxes owed before EITC Employer share of payroll taxes Federal taxes before EITC Benefit from EITC $285 $1,989 $400 $2,674 $1,989 $4,663 $1,036
D0			President Clinton's Proposal House Bill Senate Bill Child Tax Credit for family with two parents and four kids and income of $26,000 $1,238 $0 $0
D0			Notes: I:  Source: U.S. Department of Treasury. Assumes 1999 tax parameters. 2:      Estimate calculated from Congressional Budget Office Data. CBO estimates that in 1998, families with incomes between $20,000 and $30,000 would pay 1.54 percent of their income in federal excise taxes.
D0			Example #2: A Family Like Michelle Orticke's
D0			Consider afamily like Michelle Orticke 's, a receptionist from Springfield, Virginia. A family like hers with a mother and two children and an income o/$24,000 would receive a $1,000 child tax credit under President's Clinton's proposal. A family like this one would receive a smaller $651 child tax credit under the Senate bill and would receive no child tax credit under the House bill.
D0			Federal Tax Situation Before Any Child Tax Credit/I: Income taxes owed before EITC Payroll taxes (just employee share) Excise taxes/2 $1,380 $1,836 $370 Federal out-of-pocket taxes owed before EITC Employer share of payroll taxes Federal taxes before EITC Benefit from EITC $3,586 $1,836 $5,422 $1,457
D0			President Clinton's Proposal House Bill Senate Bill Child Tax Credit for family with one parent and two kids and income of $24,000 $1,000 $0 $651
D0			Notes: I:  Source: U.S. Department of Treasury. Assumes 1999 tax parameters. 2:      Estimate calculated from Congressional Budget Office Data. CBO estimates that in 1998, families with incomes between $20,000 and $30,000 would pay 1.54 percent of their income in federal excise taxes.

D0			Methodology of State-by-State Analysis
D0			Using the Treasury individual income tax model, an estimate was generated for the aggregate numbers of taxpayers in I 998 with Adjusted Gross Income below $30,000 who receive the child tax credit under President Clinton's proposal but not under the House and Senate bills. These aggregates were distributed across states in proportion to the fraction of EITC recipients nationwide in 1995 with incomes between $15,000 and $30,000 who reside in the particular state. EITC recipients with incomes between $I 5,000 and $30,000 form the group primarily affected by the differences in the child tax credit proposals. •

D0			President Clinton's Higher Education Tax Cut Proposal A Fact Sheet
D0			    • HOPE Scholarship. A maximum $1,500 credit for the first two years of postsecondary education. Students attending on at least a half-time basis would receive a 100% credit for the first $1,000 of tuition and required fees and a 50% credit for up to the next $1,000. For example, a student attending a community college with tuition costs of $1,400 would receive a $1,200 HOPE Scholarship. Scholarships would be phased out for joint filers with income between $80,000 and $ I 00,000, and for single filers with income between $50,000 and $70,000. After 2002, the HOPE Scholarship increases to a I00% credit for the first $ I,500 and a 50% credit for the next $1,000 of tuition and required fees.
D0			    • 20% Tuition Tax Credit. Undergraduates beyond their first two years, graduate students, plus working people going to school part-time to improve or acquire job skills, would benefit from a 20% tax credit on the first $5,000 of tuition and required fees through the year 2000 and after 2000 a 20% tax credit on the first $10,000 of tuition and required fees. The credit would be phased out at the same income levels as HOPE.
D0			    • Education and Retirement Savings Accounts. Allows penalty-free IRA withdrawals for undergraduate, post-secondary vocational, and graduate education expenses. Additionally, taxpayers eligible for the child tax credit are given the opportunity to deposit their child tax credit plus an additional $500, in a Kidsave Account for the child's education, first-time home purchase or the taxpayer's retirement.   Earnings would accumulate tax-free in the Kidsave Account and no taxes would be due upon withdrawal for an approved purpose.
D0			    • Employer-Provided Education Benefits. Extends permanently Section 127 of the tax code, which allows . people to exclude $5,250 of employer-provided education benefits from their taxable income. Eligibility for graduate education benefits would be reinstated retroactively back to June 30, 1996, with both undergraduate and graduate education eligible in the future. Additionally, a I 0% employer credit for small business training is included. This credit would apply to payments made to third parties to cover expenses of education for employees under employer-provided education assistance programs. The credit would be available to employers with average annual gross receipts of $10 million or less for the prior three years.
D0			    • Student Loan Interest Deduction. Allows a deduction for up to $2,500 per year of interest on education loans for expenses of students enrolled at an institution of higher education. The deduction would be allowed for the first 60 months interest is due on a loan. The deduction would phase out for taxpayers making between $45,000 and $65,000 ($65,000 and $85,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly). This deduction would be available even if the taxpayer does not itemize deductions.
D0			    • Community Service Loan Forgiveness. In most circumstances, a loan that is forgiven is considered income and is therefore taxable. To encourage programs that offer loan forgiveness to borrowers who take lower­ paying, community-service jobs, loan amounts forgiven through programs run by nonprofit tax-exempt charitable or educational institutions, and loans forgiven under the Direct Loan Program's income­ contingent repayment program, would be excluded from income. Currently, the exclusion generally covers only certain forgiveness arrangements between students and government entities.
D0			    • · Repeal Cap on Tax Exempt Bond Issuance by Colleges and Universities. Repeals the $150 million bond cap that affects private higher education institutions and certain other charitable institutions. The repeal would apply to tax-exempt bonds issued by these institutions to finance new capital expenditures.

Source: Education Department estimates based on State-level enrollment and Pell Grant recipient data.
D0			Methodology of State-by-State Analysis
D0			Using a nationally-representative sample of postsecondary students and data on Pell Grant recipients, an estimate was derived for the proportion of the total national number of recipients of the tax benefit in 1998. Using that ratio, the number of recipients for each State was determined. Based on the Joint Tax Committee and Treasury revenue estimates of the three plans for 1999, a dollar amount for each State was derived using the same ratio as the State/national number of beneficiaries.
D0			President Clinton's Higher Education Tax Cuts: Greater Benefits for More Families
D0			While providing the greatest help in the first two years, the Administration's plan has always gone much farther, granting a substantial tax cut for virtually any investment in postsecondary education or training. Unlike the Congressional plans, the President's tax credits cover more types and ages of postsecondary students, including:         ◦ part-time students (less than half-time) seeking to improve or acquire job skills;         ◦ students beyond their first two years of undergraduate study;         ◦ graduate students.
D0			Although the Administration, House and Senate plans all provide modest assistance for students who borrow or families who have special education savings accounts, for many situations that families find themselves in, the House and Senate plans provide little or no help. Consider the following:
D0			Tuition Tax Credits Under Various Situations President House Plan Senate Plan Two kids in college: Married couple, $60,000 income, with two kids in college: one at a community college with $2,000 tuition and $200 books, the other a junior at a private college with $10,000 tuition. $2,500 ($3,500 after year 2000) $1,I 00 $1,500 Divorced parent, same income: Single parent with $50,000 income, one child going to an average community college full- time ($1,200 tuition and fees) $1,100 $0 $0 Returning to school less than half-time: Family with $30,000 income, one parent going to a public four-year college part-time to change careers ($2,000 tuition and fees) $400 $0 $0 Child is beyond.first two years: Family with $40,000 income, one child is junior at average private college ($12,000 tuition and fees) $1,000 ($2,000 after year 2000) $0 $0 Returning to school full-time to become a teacher: Homemaker, family income of $70,000, attending graduate teacher training program at public university after being out of college for 20 years ($3,500 tuition). $700 $0 $0 Graduate student: Single graduate student with$15,000 income and tuition of $15,000. $1,000 $0 $0

T0			Karen:
D1			Elena asked that I send you a note to let you know that we spoke to ONDCP, and that they said that General Mccaffrey is committed to doing a press availability on the !OM-Medical Marijuana study tomorrow. After two  years of  pointing to the study, he feels obligated to  go on the record when it is released -- and, despite our suggestion, is not willing to pull back. I have attached McCaffrey's proposed statement and the Q&A prepared by his staff. If you still have concerns about the press availability, you or John will probably need to connect w/him directly. As you know, he doesn't feel obliged to take guidance  from us on this or any other matter he views as his responsibility.

D1			Q & A's for the Director on the IOM Report Prepared by Dan Schecter, Kate Malliarakis, Carol Gibson March 15, 1999
D1			    1. Does this report validate the message sent by voters in California, Arizona, Alaska, Washington,. Oregon, Nevada?
D1			    • I've said before that using the ballot to decide what  should  become  medicine is like asking the voters  to  make  air  traffic  control  decisions. We have always said and we continue to affirm  that  science,  not  the  ballot  box, should determine the practice of medicine.
D1			    • The report says that it is impossible to  estimate the  clinical  value  of marijuana and cannabinoids based on anecdotal reports. (Page 1 .19 IOM Report) This report does not address the political process that makes marijuana  available to  medically needy individuals.    And, it doesn't address public policy questions  such as the  distribution of  marijuana. But, the sense of the report indicates that distribution  marijuana  through  places  like Cannabis Buyers clubs would be inconsistent  with sensible  scientific practices.
D1			    2. Will ONDCP's position on the medical use of marijuana change as a result of this report?
D1			    • Actually this report supports ONDCP's position, as it highlights the need for targeted research on the compounds in marijuana that may be helpful to those in medical need.
D1			    • Medical advancement means rigorous testing before a new  drug is released to the public. To recognize this reality is not to shut out  the  possibility  of merit in the cannabis plant but it is to reject exaggerated, at times magical, claims for marijuana.
D1			"    3. The very first recommendation of the IOM study is to conduct more research into the effects of cannabinoids.   Yet it is impossible  to get marijuana in order to conduct research. Will you use the influence of your position to see that access to marijuana is placed on the ""fast track"" so that legitimate researchers can conduct the research called for in the IOM study?"
D1			    • The Federal government has established a process for determining the safety and efficacy of drugs. It is a process that has been in place and has proven l[fomques!.wpd  Page 271 to  work. I will continue to work with NIDA and FDA and NIH to  ensure  that this process is efficient and still protects the American public.
D1			"    4. The study very emphatically states (Page ES.7) that there is ""no conclusive evidence that the drug effects of marijuana are causally linked to the subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs."" What does this say about the ""Gateway Theory"" that you have held?"
D1			"    • The study actually supports the fact that most drug users begin with  nicotine, move to alcohol, and then to marijuana. The new point brought out in this report is that the use of marijuana for medical purposes does not fall into the ""gateway theory."""
D1			    •  The significant point is that this study says that we need more research to determine just exactly where and how research on the compounds of marijuana should be conducted.
D1			    5. Now that the IOM has concluded that there are potential medical benefits to marijuana, will the Federal government continue to arrest and incarcerate sick people who use the drug for pain relief?
D1			"    • There is nothing in the IOM report that concludes that there are benefits to smoked marijuana. In fact, the IOM report states that ""smoked marijuana is unlikely to be a safe medication for any chronic medical  condition."" (Page 3.48)"
D1			    • This question goes to the crux of the problem. On one hand, we have people who want an excuse to smoke marijuana to get high, claiming that they have debilitating medical conditions. On the other hand, we have a small group of terminally ill people who believe (rightly or wrongly) that marijuana offers them some relief.
D1			    • Federal law enforcement policy will continue to be as it has been--focused on drug traffickers.
D1			    • What we really need is for pharmaceutical companies to develop alternative delivery systems for the compounds in marijuana.
D1			    6. Will you now concede that there is medicinal value to marijuana?
D1			    • The IOM report raises serious questions about the medicinal value of smoked /[iomquest.wpd  Page 37/ marijuana.
D1			    • We've always supported the use of synthetic THC--dronabinol--in treating certain illnesses. The issue is smoked marijuana.
D1			    • What we need are alternative delivery  systems  to  ensure that those  few people who can't take dronabinol  have an effective  means  of  deriving whatever benefits are available in THC without the harmful effects of smoke. @nt. oc Page 3JI

D0			WHITE HOUSE DRUG POLICY OFFICE ISSUES STATEMENT ON INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE'S REPORT ON MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE
D0			(202) 395-6618 (Washington, D.C.) - The White House Office of National Drug Policy (ONDCP) issued the following statement today following the release of the Institute of Medicine's report Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base:
D0			In January 1997, ONDCP asked the Institute of Medicine to conduct a review of the scientific evidence for assessing the potential health benefits and risks of marijuana and its constituent cannabinoids. ONDCP believed that an objective and independent evaluation of research regarding the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes was appropriate given the ongoing debate about cannabis and its health effects.
D0			The report released today by the Institute of Medicine represents the most thorough analysis to date of the relevant scientific literature. It summarizes recent advances in molecular and behavioral neuroscience, in particular newly elaborated systems of transmitters, receptors, and antagonists - all illuminating the physiological effects of cannabinoids. The Institute of Medicine has addressed all issues that ONDCP requested be examined, including: the science base and gaps in scientific knowledge regarding use of marijuana for medicinal purposes; scientific information about marijuana's mechanism of action; peer-reviewed literature on the uses of marijuana; and costs associated with various forms of the component chemical compounds in marijuana and other pharmacotherapies for special medical conditions. We thank the principal investigators, members of the advisory panel, biomedical and social scientists, patients, advocates, report reviewers, and all who supported the Institute of Medicine in developing this comprehensive report.
D0			The report contains six specific recommendations that address: Continued research into the physiological effects of cannabinoids. Clinical trials of cannabinoid drugs for symptom management. Evaluation of psychological effects of cannabinoids in clinical trials. Studies of individual health risks in smoking marijuana. Clinical trials of marijuana use under limited circumstances for medical purposes. Short-term use of smoked marijuana under strict conditions for patients with debilitating symptoms. These recommendations are supported by the following observations: Scientific data indicate the potential therapeutic value of cannabinoids for pain relief, control of nausea and vomiting, and appetite stimulation. This value would be enhanced by a rapid onset of drug effect.     • l[slmrt.do'ci;;;  :========================= Page 4-11
D0			The psychological effects of cannabinoids are probably important determinants of their potential therapeutic value. They can influence symptoms indirectly, which could create false impressions of the drug effect or be beneficial as a form of adjunctive therapy.
D0			Numerous studies suggest that marijuana smoke is an important risk factor in the development of respiratory diseases, but the data that could conclusively establish or refute this suspected link have not been collected.
D0			Because marijuana is a crude THC delivery system that also delivers harmful substances, smoked marijuana generally should not be recommended for medical use. Nonetheless, marijuana is widely used by certain patient groups, which raises both safety and efficacy issues.
D0			If there is any future for marijuana as medicine, it lies in its isolated components -- the cannabinoids and their synthetic derivatives. Isolated cannabinoids will provide more reliable effects than crude plant mixtures. Therefore, the purpose of clinical trials of smoked marijuana would not be to develop marijuana as a licensed drug, but such trials could be a first step towards the development of rapid-onset, nonsmoked cannabinoid delivery systems.
D0			"ONDCP appreciates the contributions made by the Institute of Medicine to the debate on the medical efficacy and safety of cannabinoids. We will carefully study the recommendations and conclusions contained in this report. We will continue to rely on the professional judgement of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Director of the National Institutes of Health, and the Surgeon General on all issues related to the medical value of marijuana and its constituent cannabinoids. We note the report's conclusion that ""the future of cannabinoid drugs lies not in smoked marijuana, but in chemically-defined drugs that act on the cannabinoid systems that are a natural component of human physiology."" We look forward to the considered responses from our nation's public health officials to the interim solutions recommended by the report. - 30 –"

D0			Q &  A Methadone  Expansion  Announcement ) (    ON\) C°P  l.,M ._,,._,J
D0			What is the scope of the heroin problem?
D0			"Although a relatively small percentage of America's illegal drug users use heroin, the debilitating addictive effects of the drug make it one of the major sources of drug-related health, crime, and social costs. ONDCP estimates a population of 810,000 chronic heroin users in the United States in 1995. While the number of new heroin initiates is still relatively low, it is apparent that the availability of high-purity heroin (which can be smoked or snorted as well as injected) has led to an increase in use -- probably because users see smoking and snorting as ""safer"" than shooting up."
D0			What are the impacts of heroin use?
D0			Heroin is a toxic substance: The danger of a fatal overdose is more immediate and likely for a heroin user than for users of other common drugs of abuse because of the route of ingestion and common miscalculations of dosage. The National Institute of Drug Abuse has declared that heroin is a powerfully addicting substance producing tolerance, physical dependence, and the clinical state of addiction (defined as compulsive, often truly uncontrollable drug craving, seeking, and use).
D0			Heroin use is associated with crime: The need to purchase large amounts of a costly drug inevitably leads to crime. For decades some cities have estimated that over half of all property crime is attributable to heroin use. Twenty percent of all people arrested in Manhattan in 1997 tested positive for opiates. In the same year, 22 percent of all arrestees in Chicago tested positive for opiates.
D0			Heroin use affects public health: There is a strong nexus between heroin use and many life­ threatening communicable diseases, including infections such as hepatitis B and C, HIV/AIDS, and endocarditis; as well as tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases (especially as they relate to pregnancy outcomes).
D0			Why is methadone treatment needed?
D0			Heroin addiction is difficult to overcome: The psycho-pharmacological effects of heroin are extremely strong. Heroin users are more likely to be addicted to the drug than users of other drugs. (An ONDCP study of cocaine, crack, and heroin abuse in six cities found that the percentage of heroin users who used heroin for 30 or more consecutive days over a 90 day period was four times greater than the percentage for crack and powder cocaine users).
D0			Kicking the heroin habit without methadone as a bridge to abstinence is difficult: the same study found that heroin users reporting 30 or more consecutive days of abstinence in a 90 day period tended to be lower than for crack or powder cocaine users.
D0			Why Methadone?
D0			"Methadone has been used for the treatment of heroin addiction since the 1960s. It is a synthetic agonist agent for opiates. In other words, methadone operates by ""occupying"" the brain receptor sites that are affected by heroin and blocks the craving attendant to addiction. Because withdrawal from methadone is slower than from heroin, it is relatively easy to maintain an addict on methadone without abrupt side effects."
D0			Methadone treatment is the most widely used treatment for heroin addiction today. It has been studied more than any other drug treatment modality, with uniformly positive results. Over 115,000 Americans are able to lead stable lives as a result of methadone treatment. Over 900 methadone treatment programs in America provide an invaluable service.
D0			Some people have criticized methadone. How effective is methadone?
D0			The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) has conducted literally dozens of studies which show the effectiveness of methadone treatment. The Drug Abuse Treatment Outcome Study (DATOS), the most recent study by NIDA, found that among participants in outpatient methadone treatment, weekly heroin use decreased 69 percent, cocaine use by 48 percent (many heroin users are polydrug users), illegal activity decreased 52 percent, and full time work increased by 24 percent.
D0			How much does methadone treatment cost?
D0			Methadone treatment, at an average cost of$13 or less per day, is a cost effective alternative to incarceration.
D0			Given methadone's effectiveness, why is this new initiative needed?
D0			In spite of this proven track record, methadone treatment capacity has not experienced marked growth. Treatment capacity is insufficient to provide most of the 810,000 heroin addicts with methadone treatment or any other effective form of drug abuse treatment. In 1995, the Institute of Medicine identified ten states in which methadone treatment was not available at all: Arkansas, Idaho, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Vermont, and West Virginia.
D0			Additionally, studies have shown that not all methadone treatment programs are equal; the full benefits of methadone treatment are only obtained within a comprehensive treatment environment, which screens and evaluates patients and assigns them to treatment regimes based upon the nature of each patient's addiction. However, a 1990 GAO report found that policies, goals and practices varied greatly and that not one of the programs studied evaluated the effectiveness of their treatment. The failures of the unsuccessful programs tarnished the entire idea of methadone treatment, rather than spurring efforts to improve the delivery of services. This initiative is designed to ensure uniform effectiveness through new standards for all programs.
D0			How will this initiative make methadone treatment more available, more effective, and better controlled?
D0			    • Expansion of Treatment Capacity: The President's National Drug Control Strategy calls for an expansion of drug treatment capacity across the board. Specifically the Strategy seeks to reduce the gap between need and capacity by 20 percent by 2002 and by 50 percent by 2007. For heroin addicts, this means that we must increase treatment capacity to reach all who are prepared to accept effective drug treatment and supervision.
D0			    • Development of a standardized accreditation system for methadone treatment programs with transfer of regulatory oversight for methadone from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA):
D0			Replace the current regulatory approach, which focuses exclusively on process standards, with a new system that is more reflective of on an outcome-oriented accreditation model. CSAT/SAMHSA will lead the interagency effort to evaluate the accreditation process and proposed accreditation standards beginning in 1999. Based on the results of the evaluation, feedback from treatment experts, and public comments on the NPRM, a final rule will be promulgated that will introduce modernized treatment standards and an accreditation process. In the interim, programs will remain subject to FDA oversight and monitoring. Law enforcement (anti-diversion) responsibilities will remain with DEA.
D0			    • Elimination of regulatory barriers to allow individual physician administration of methadone: As physician training in the administration of opioid agonist treatment is accomplished, we must change the ineffective regulations which hinder effective treatment and allow trained physicians flexibility in how to administer this treatment (for example, through office visits as opposed to clinical programs). New regulations expanding access to methadone will be issued when testing has validated their effectiveness.
D1			How will this effort be paid for?
D1			The President's drug treatment budget request exceeds $3 billion, an increase of$206.5 million over FY 1998. Funding for this initiative will come from the treatment component of the President's counter-drug budget.

T0			July 8, 1998 DRUG MEDIA CAMPAIGN LAUNCH
T0			DATE:   July 9, 1998 LOCATION:   Sidney J. Marcus Auditorium World Congress Center MEET & GREET: 9:45 am - I 0:00 am EVENT TIME: 10: 15 am - 11 :25 am FROM:   Bruce Reed
D1			    I. PURPOSE
D1			To launch the largest ever national media campaign to target youth drug use and educate young people and their parents on the dangers of drugs.
D1			    II. BACKGROUND
D1			At this event, you will launch the national expansion of the historic youth anti-drug media campaign -- which is already underway in 12 pilot cities. This is the largest publicly funded anti-drug campaign, with a total proposed budget of $1 billion over five years and a dollar-for-dollar match from each media outlet airing the ads. Using the full power of the mass media to change youth attitudes toward drugs, the campaign will ensure that when teens and adults turn on the television, listen to the radio, or surf the Internet, they will get the message that drugs are dangerous, wrong, and can kill you. Children are exposed to many media messages that normalize drugs.  The campaign will utilize modem media and technology to give alternative messages that will compete with these influences.
D1			By changing attitudes, youth drug use can be reduced. Studies of drug use rates over the last thirty years show that when young people disapprove of drugs and consider them dangerous, youth use rates decline. Furthermore, we now know that if a child can reach the age of 21 without using drugs, he or she will probably never use them.
D1			Specifically, you will announce the following:
D1			"        ◦ A television ""roadblock"" that will air Thursday evening -- where every network will show the same counter-drug ad at 9:00 PM (EST). This ad will reach an estimated 85 percent of American television viewers. The roadblock will be supplemented by print ads in the nation's top 100 newspapers and radio ads in the top 100 media markets."
D1			        ◦ Local media buys to target specific drug problems in certain regions of the country. All new ads will provide the campaign clearinghouse number (800-288- 7800) that will be staffed 24 hours a day and provide information on drug prevention. The campaign's new interactive website for parents and youth (www.projectknow.com.) will also be unveiled at the event.
D1			        ◦   The anti-drug media campaign is more than just ads. It is coupled with public­ '!,rivate partnerships that will generate a wide range of coordinated anti-drug activities with schools, civic organizations, community anti-drug coalitions, and others. It also challenges media outlets to match the campaign's efforts -- on a dollar for dollar basis -- with related pro-bona ads or programming time for youth drug prevention.
D1			You will be addressing audience of 600: including; 300 students ages 11-15 throughout Georgia; parents; local anti-drug advocates; community activists; and Members of Congress. In addition, the event will be carried live to over 150 satellite event sites around the country.
D1			    III. PARTICIPANTS Event Participants: General McCaffrey Speaker Newt Gingrich Senator Max Cleland Governor Zell Miller Mayor Bill Campbell James Miller, 17 yeai;-old from Portland, Oregon. James co-chairs the Regional Drug Initiative and speaks to kids about staying drug free. He is committed to not using drugs because of the pain caused by his mother's addiction when he was young. Kim Willis, 8th grader from Erie, Pennsylvania. She is very active in her school's anti­ drug coalition Kids Interacting Drug-Free Coalition (KIDco). She serves as the KIDco leader for her class and represents her Region in the Statewide organization.

D1			Taking the President's Anti-Drug Media Campaign Nationwide July 9, 1998
D1			Today in Atlanta, the President launches the national expansion of the Anti-Drug Media Campaign he first proposed in last year's drug strategy and budget. The kick-off of the 5-year, $2 billion Anti-Drug Media Campaign will be linked by satellite to over 150 sites around the country.
D1			The Largest Targeted Effort Ever to Teach Youth About Drugs The President's Anti-Drug Media Campaign is designed to use the full power of the mass media to change youth attitudes toward drugs. It is designed to let teens know -- when they turn on the television, listen to the radio, or surf the 'Net -- that drugs are dangerous, wrong and can kill you. Activities planned for today's nationwide launch include:
D1			"            ▪ A television ""roadblock"" that will air this evening -- where every network will show the same counter-drug ad at 9:00p.m. (EST). This ad will reach an estimated 85 percent of American television viewers. The roadblock will be supplemented by print ads in the nation's top I 00 newspapers and radio ads in the top 100 media markets."
D1			            ▪ Local media buys to target specific drug problems in certain regions of the country. All new ads will provide the campaign clearinghouse number (800-288-7800) that will be staffed 24 hours a day and provide information on drug prevention. The campaign's new interactive website for parents and youth (www.projectknow.com.) will also be unveiled.
D1			            ▪ In January I 998, the campaign began in 12 pilot cities (Atlanta, Baltimore, Boise, Denver, Hartford, Houston, Milwaukee, Portland (OR), San Diego, Sioux City, Tucson, and Washington, D.C.). Since ads started to run in these pilot cities, anti-drug awareness has increased and requests for anti-drug publications increased by more than 300 percent.
D1			More Than an Ad Campaign             ▪ The anti-drug media campaign is more than just ads. It is coupled with public-private partnerships that will generate a wide range of coordinated anti-drug activities with schools, civic organizations, community anti-drug coalitions, and others. It also challenges media outlets to match the campaign's efforts -- on a dollar for dollar basis -­ with related pro-bono ads or programming time for youth drug prevention.
D1			A Record of Accomplishment             ▪ The President has consistently proposed the largest, most ambitious anti-drug budgets ever -- and more than $17 billion for FY 99. His 1998 National Drug Control Strategy is a comprehensive ten-year plan designed to cut drug use and its availability in half. Among other initiatives, the Strategy continues the anti-drug media campaign, funds improves and expands the Safe and Drug-Free Schools program, shields our borders with 1,000 new Border Patrol officers and advanced drug detection technologies, strengthens law enforcement with new DEA agents to crack down on heroin and methamphetamine traffickers, and cuts crime by testing and treating crime-committing addicts.
D0			PRESIDENT CLINTON: REDUCING TEENAGE DRUG USE
T0			July 9, 1998
D0			"""Parents, the media, athletes, the government -- all of us must fa/fill our obligation to protect our children from drugs. But nothing we do will make a bit of difference unless young people also take responsibility for themselves.   No one is too young to understand that drugs are wrong. No one is too immature to take responsibility and say no to drugs. We will do everything we can to help you -- but in the end, it is up to you. You can use drugs and risk your life, or you can reject drugs and reach for your dreams. As the ad we saw today said: 'Any Questions?'"""
T0			President Bill Clinton July 9, 1998
D1			THE LARGEST TARGETED EFFORT EVER To TEACH YOUTH ABOUT DRUGS. The President's Anti-Drug Media Campaign is designed to use the full power of the mass media to change youth attitudes toward drugs. This Campaign is designed to let teens know -- when they tum on the television, listen to the radio, or access the Internet -- that drugs are dangerous, wrong, and can kill you. Today's announcement will be reinforced by:
D1			"    • A television ""roadblock"" that will air this evening -- where every network will show the same anti-drug advertisement this evening during the 9:00 p.m. (EDT) viewing hour. This advertisement will reach an estimated 85 million viewers. The roadblock advertisement will be supplemented by print ads in the nation's top 100 newspapers and radio ads in the top I 00 media markets"
D1			    • Local media buys to target svecific drug vroblems in certain regions of the country. All new advertisements will provide the Campaign's clearinghouse number (1-800-288-7800), which will be staffed 24 hours a day and provide information on drug prevention. The campaign's new interactive web site (www.projectknow.com) will also be unveiled.
D1			    • Existing vrograms that started in 12 cities earlier this year. In January 1998, the Campaign began in 12 pilot cities. These cities have seen an increase in anti-drug awareness and a 300 percent increase in requests for anti-drug publications.
D1			A PARTNERSITTP WITH THEPRIVATE SECTOR. The Campaign is more than just a series of advertisements. It is coupled with a public-private partnership that will generate a wide range of coordinated anti-drug activities with schools, civic organizations, community anti-drug coalitions and others. The Campaign is also challenging media outlets to match, on a dollar for dollar basis, the efforts put forth by the Campaign with time for youth drug prevention programming or related pro-bono ads.
D1			BUILDING ON A RECORD OF ACCOMPLISHMENT. The President has made drug interdiction and prevention a top priority during his term in office, including:
D1			    • The Largest Anti-Drug Budgets Ever. The President has consistently proposed the largest anti-drug budgets ever. Between 1996 and 1998, resources for drug control increased by 19%, and the President's budget for fiscal year 1999 calls for an increase in funding for drug control, youth drug prevention efforts, domestic law enforcement, and interdiction.
D1			    • Developing a Comprehensive National Drug Control Strategy. The President has announced a comprehensive ten-year plan to reduce drug use and its consequences in the United States by 50%. This strategy will help reduce illegal drug use through law enforcement, prevention, treatment, interdiction and international cooperation.
D1			    • Strengthening and Expanding the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act. President Clinton expanded the Drug-Free Schools Act into the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Act of 1994, making violence prevention a key part of this program. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program provides support for violence and drug prevention programs to 97% of the nation's school districts. Schools  use  these  funds  to  keep  violence,  drugs  and alcohol away from students and out of schools. '   V.  !\l f)  •   .   •    - '

T0			For Immediate Release   July 9, 1998
T0			REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT IN LAUNCHING THE NATIONAL YOUTH ANTI-DRUG MEDIA CAMPAIGN
T0			Sidney Marcus Auditorium Georgia World Congress Center
T0			Atlanta, Georgia
T0			10:40 A.M. EDT
D0			THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you very much. (Applause.) First  of  all, let's begin by  giving Kim and James  another  hand. Didn't they do a good job?  (Applause.)   They spoke well for you.  ·
D0			Mr. Speaker, Governor Miller, Mr. Mayor, General McCaffrey, General Reno, Secretary Shalala, I thank you all for your superb efforts in this endeavor. I'd like to say a special word of appreciation to Jim Burke, the President of the Partnership for a Drug Free America. He's not as well-known to most American children as the President or the Speaker or the Governor, but no American has done more to save the children of this country from the horror of drug abuse than Jim Burke. And we all owe him a very great debt of gratitude. Thank you. (Applause.)
D0			I'd also like to thank the Ad Council, the Community Anti-Drug Coalition, the athletic teams and sports figures that are represented here today, the business groups, the Georgia Attorney General, and Agriculture Commissioner of the other state and municipal and county officials -- and Congress Peter Deutch • from Florida is here with us today. I thank all of them for being here. And there are many others who aren't here who are supporting what we are doing together as Americans.
D0			   I was interested when we just watched the ads  to  see what  the young people's reaction was to the various ads. I was wondering to myself whether the ads that were most effective with me were also the ones that were most effective to you, or whether they were  different. I say that  to  make the point that the
D0			Speaker made so eloquently -- in the end this is about you, what touches you, what you believe, what your convictions are.
D0			We know from the stories that we just heard from James and from Kim, we know from all the available scientific research, that what Governor Miller said is right -- attitudes drive actions. There are lots of other factors. There are some places where kids are subject to more temptation than others; there are some blocks where there are more drug dealers than others;  all of  us have to  deal  with  that.   But we know that the more young people fear drugs, the more they disapprove of them, the less likely they are to use them. Therefore, kicking America's drug habit requires a dramatic change in attitudes, accompanied and reenforced by a dramatic increase in personal responsibility by all Americans.
D0			Parents have the greatest power -- that's what one of the ads showed us. The ads we saw today are not meant to replace parents' voices, but to  reenforce them. Ultimately,  the best drug enforcement program, the best drug prevention program is an effective, caring, loving parent sitting down with a child and talking seriously about drugs early.
D0			Parents have already told us that these ads help to break the ice with their children. So I ask the  parents of America today, don't wait until your children are using drugs to talk to them about drugs. Watch the ads together and discuss them, beginning tonight.
D0			Every one of the rest of us can, and must, help parents to teach their children to turn away from drugs. The entertainment industry can shape attitudes, as anyone who has a teenager can tell you. The media should never glamorize drugs. I'm pleased that across the  entertainment  industry,  a real effort is now being made to help, with the anti-drug messages on the Wonderful World of Disney, anti-drug chat groups on America Online, even training sessions about youth drug use for screenwriters and producers at Fox -- something I hope we will see for all people who prepare television programs on all networks.
D0			Professional athletes can shape attitudes. I thank Major League Soccer, the Florida Marlins, the New York Mets, Atlanta's own Braves for agreeing to air the ads during their home games. And while one of government's primary responsibilities is to enforce the law -- and we should -- we can also support this change in attitudes.
D0			As General  McCaffrey  said,  with  the help  of  the Speaker and people from across the political spectrum, we have aggressively pursued a comprehensive anti-drug strategy. We've put more police on our streets. We've strengthened our border patrols. We've toughened penalties. We do more drug testing of prisoners and parolees to break the link between crime and drugs. We work more with countries where drugs are grown and processed to try to stop the drugs from coming into the United States in the first place.
D0			But with this ad campaign, in which the public's investment is matched dollar for dollar by private partners, America is mounting a new and sweeping effort to change the attitude of an entire generation of young people.
D0			Already, we've seen an impact in the 12 cities where the ads have run as a pilot project. Calls -- listen to this --in just those 12 cities, calls to local anti-drug coalition hotlines have increased by up to 500 percent. Calls to our national anti-drug helpline have nearly tripled. Young people here in Atlanta say that the ads make them realize the serious consequences of using drugs. In Denver, middle school students think the ads could scare kids out  of  using drugs, to quote one of them. In Washington, D.C., young people say, to quote one, the ads make them stop and think about what illegal drugs can do.
D0			Tonight, when these ads run on every national television network, they will reach more than 40 million Americans, including millions and millions of children. That is  just the beginning. Over the next five years, we'll help to make sure that when young people turn on the television, listen to the radio, read the newspaper, or surf the Web, they get the powerful message that drugs are wrong, illegal, and can kill.
D0			I'm proud to say, as has already been said by General McCaffrey, that this national media campaign was a part of the historical bipartisan balanced budget agreement reached last year with Speaker Gingrich and the other leaders of Congress. And I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for including this in our budget agreement. It shows what we can accomplish when we put progress ahead of partisanship. I will work with the Congress to fund other important programs in our drug control strategy.
D0			All of us -- parents, the media, athletes, business, government -- have an opportunity and an obligation to make a real difference in the  fight  against  drugs.  But nothing  we do will succeed, as the Speaker said, unless young people also take responsibility for themselves.
D0			We've heard some personal stories; I'd like to close with two -- one from my family, and one from the job the American people have so generously given me these six years. Let me begin with the job.
D0			I spent a lot of time haranguing, cajoling, trying to persuade, sometimes putting brutal pressure on countries where drugs are grown or processed, or through which drugs pass, trying to get people to stop doing things that send drugs  to us.  And we've had some success. We supported remarkable efforts by the Coast Guard, for example, to cut off drugs before they get to this country. But  we can never  cut  off  the  whole  flow.  And every time I'd do this, some leader of a country where drugs are grown will say: You know, Mr. President, you're right,  we have a lot of poor farmers in our country, and I wish they'd grow something else. But America has four percent of the  world's people and you're buying almost 50 percent of the world's drugs. Nobody is making you buy those drugs. So you can say whatever you want to us.  If  you just  said tomorrow  -- everybody  in America said, we're not going to buy any more drugs, all our farmers would immediately start to grow something legal and good. And that's true. (Applause.)
D0			Now, that doesn't let them off the hook, it  doesn't excuse the inexcusable behavior of the Colombian drug cartels or any other groups in any part of the world. But it is true. It is true. It doesn't mean we should stop trying to kill the drugs at the border and stop the imports and break the drug gangs. But it's true. If  every  American young person tomorrow  said, no, thank  you, they  would grow something else.   The laboratories would make other chemicals that are legal and not harmful. (Applause.)
D0			I'll tell you another story that's fairly well-known, but I want you to think about what it means for families. This young man was brave enough to say that his mother used drugs, and talk about what -- the pain it caused the family. My brother  nearly  died from a cocaine habit. And I've asked myself a thousand times, what kind of fool  was I that  I did not know this  was going on.   You know, I got myself  elected President, I'm supposed to know what people are thinking, what's going on in their minds. How did this happen that I didn't see this coming and didn't stop it?
D0			And when it all happened he said -- I said, when did this start? He said,  well, in high school; I started using marijuana and drinking beer. I said, how often? He said, every day. And I thought to myself, what kind of family member was I? And these things make you do really bad things. They make you abuse other people. Most of the people selling drugs on the street are out there  supporting  their  own  habits. So you take other people, people who are basically good people, and you turn them into animals, because they don't care what they do to anybody else because they've got to get the money if they have to destroy somebody else, so they can keep feeding their own habits. They destroy  families.  Mothers  who love their  sons wind up neglecting them, abusing them, walking away, weakening the family. Everybody gets hurt. Nobody in America is free of this. Not the President. Not any community, any school, any church, any neighborhood.
D0			So the hardest thing in the  world  to  do is to  get people to change their habits, especially if what you're doing feels  good in the  moment. But it's very important.   Nothing is so important -- not the laws, not the investments, not anything. Nothing is so important as what the American people get up and do every day, just because they think it's theright thing to do. Nothing comes close to it.
D0			So we're here today because we took a little bit of the money the American people gave the national government -- a billion dollars over the next five years -- put it with at least that much and maybe more coming from private sources, to send a message to all these kids. I look at all these little girls out here in their Girl Scouts or their Brownie uniforms -- the message seems simple today. When they're 14 or 15 or 16 or 17 or 18, and life  gets more  complicated,  it's real important  that  they carry  with them the message that they have today deep in their  heart.
D0			I look at all these kids with these America's Pride tee-shirts on, and what I want them to do is to go back and somehow reach all those kids that are in their schools that don't wear those tee-shirts. There's somebody like my brother back at your school who is a good kid, just a little lost.  Somebody  told him something is all right that wasn't. And the family members were just  a little out of it  and  couldn't  believe it  was going on. You can save them. That's what these ads are all about.
D0			These ads are designed to knock America  upside  the head and get America's attention, and to empower all of  you  who  are trying to do the right thing. (Applause.) Please do it.
D0			Thank you and God bless you. (Applause.)

T0			cc: Subject: Drug Radio Address
D1			The drug PSAs are ready to be unveiled and we could have the President announce them in  the Radio  Address -- and distribute  them  to  all the  news organizations  to  get  some free media. The first one will air in DC/Balitmore media market on Jan. 51 so we should try to find a time for the President to launch them before or on the 5th. After that, Members of Congress  will be holding their own  press conferences  in their districts to roll them out.   If  we want  to  announce  them this weekend, we still need to check with Media and Leg. Affairs, so we should decide quickly. If we don't do it this weekend, does everyone agree we should submit a scheduling for a Presidential event on or before the 5th? Let me know. Thanks.      - He   e! A--ir- THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON

T0			Dear President Clinton:
D1			We need your help. Our proposed $175 million youth-oriented, anti-drug media campaign is at risk. It has yet to gain broad congressional support from Republicans.
D1			We are now entering the short mark-up period during which the campaign's  fate will be decided.  Would sugge t that using a Saturday radio address to endorse the campaign would help sway those who are still unconvinced about its merits.
D1			There are many demands on your time. Few, however, offer such a potential pay-off. As you know, drug use has doubled among our youth, tripling among eighth graders in the past five years. We are confident this campaign can drive down drug use rates among eighth-graders by fifteen percent within three years. Your intervention will increase our chances of succeeding. . :· •·
T0			<.:..:: Very respectfully,
T0			The Honorable William Jefferson Clinton The White House
T0			EXECUflVE OFFICE OF THE PRFSIDENT OFFICE OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY Washington,  D.C. 20S03
D0			Potential Benefits of ONDCP's Youth-Oriented Anti-Drug Media Campaign
D1			PURPOSE. To suggest the potential benefits of the $175 million youth-oriented anti-drug campaign on a typical congressional district.
D1			ASSUMPTIONS.
D1			    1. Without inten'ention, usage of illegal drugs will continue to rise among America's 68 million children.
D1			    2. There are approximately 7,250 eighth-graders in a typical congressional district. This number will not change drastically in the next five years.
D1			        ◦ If the increase in current usage rates of the past five years among 8th-graders is unchecked, by 2001, 22.8% of eight-graders will be using illegal drugs. That means 1,653 8th-graders in a typical congressional district would be using illegal drugs.
D1			    3. This $175 million media campaign, in conjunction with other ongoing drug prevention efforts, will result in a fifteen percent reduction in drug usage rates among our youth.
D1			        ◦ The annual investment, per child, of this campaign is just $2.57.
D1			POTENTIAL BENEFITS.
D1			    1. If the media campaign is fully funded, 551 fewer 8th-g raderswill be using drugs in e;,ich congressional district in 2001.
D1			    2. This reduction in use translates into dramatic savings.
D1			        ◦ Columbia University's Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse estimates that children who smoke marijuana are eighty-five times more likely to use cocaine.
D1			        ◦ A recent study suggests that the saving a high-risk youth (i.e. a current illegal drug user) might prevent costs to society of between $1.5 - $2 million -- the estimated damage caused by a typical addict over a life-time of drug use.
D1			        ◦ If this Campaign deters just one 8th-grader in each congressional district from beginning the descent toward addiction, the campaign will have achieved a three-fold return on a modest investment.

T0			ONDCP's National Anti-Drug Media Campaign
D1			    • The challenge: To reverse the current sharp rise in illegal drug use by young Americans.
D1			    • The Problem:
D1			        ◦ Drug use has been increasing among our youth over the past five years, tripling among eighth graders.
D1			        ◦ This upsurge in drug usage rates was preceded by changing attitudes towards drugs. Young Americans became more tolerant of illegal drug use and less worried about the consequences.
D1			        ◦ Anti-drug messages have declined markedly since 1989, even while messages normalizing illegal drug use have proliferated in popular music, TV, film, Internet, fashion, humor, and other forms of mass communications.
D1			    • The rationale for a funded anti-drug media campaign.
D1			        ◦ Targeted, mass media advertising works. It sells products and ideas from cereals to seat belt use.
D1			        ◦ Public Service Announcements (PSAs) by themselves are insufficient. They do not reach the right audiences with the required frequency because they air sporadically and in the wrong time spots.
D1			        ◦ Children spend mor time watching TV than in school.  Other media outlets (i.e._ radio, cinema, computer software, the Internet, newspapers, and magazines) are also vehicles to reach young Americans and their parents.  ·
D1			    • Why $175 million?
D1			        ◦ The cost of effectiveness -- reaching 90% of all 9 - 17 year olds at least four times a week.
D1			        ◦ In line with per capita costs(< $1) of publicly-funded CA & MA anti-smoking campaigns.
D1			"        ◦ Represents ""seed money."" Crucial component of the campaign is matching contributions from corporate partners."

T0			To: Bruce N. Reed/OPD/EOP cc: Elena Kagan/OPD/EOP Subject: McCaffrey PSA Campaign
D1			"For FY 98, McCaffrey has requested iet $175 million for a ""national media campaign targeting illegal drug consumption by youth. This initiative would rely on high-impact, anti-drug television advertisements aired during prime-time to educate and inform the public on the dangers of illegal drug use."""
D1			"This is the  totality  of information that McCaffrey  now  has on  this initiative. He has had several conversations with Jim Burke, with the Partnership for  Drug-Free  America  (the folks  who did ""this is your brain, this is your brain on drugs"") about getting industry to match every dollar that  we provide -- - $350 million for a national media campaign is not bad."
D1			McCaffrey's conversations w/ Burke are probably a reflection of something the POTUS said in a meeting. On December 12,  1996, the President  had his  Drug Council Meeting  -- which is effectively  a Cabinet  Meeting focused on drugs.   During the closed meeting, McCaffrey mentioned the ad campaign  and both POTUS and VPOTUS were extremely interested. POTUS  wanted to write a letter to the networks pointing out how few anti-drug PSAs there are on TV these days --  I think there is a 30% drop since 1990, andthen challenging them to match our funding for a media campaign.  Gore was  going to talk to Reed Hundt. I sent Rahm a memo about this back then.
D1			Mentioning the National Media Campaign for drug-free youth would be good SOTU material -­ which I assume is why you were asking -- especially if he was challenging the TV industry/media to match the contribution -- - shame them and then challenge them (I bet we could get a read from Jim Burke beforehand whether this would be a challenge that could be met before POTUS did it).

D0			Bruce, Elena, Rahm:
D1			After reviewing the draft Meth and drug testing, here are my reactions:
D1			    1. Meth report shows our strategy is working. Subst ve and newsworthy items include: (1) preliminary '96 data show that  meth use is down fron\ZJo  52 percent  in  most  cities;  (2) clandestine lab seizures have increased 170% (from 326 in '95 to 879 in '96), and '97 seizures are escalating; (3) increased meth penalties recently released by Sentencing Commission and will take effect on 11/1/97; and (4) good, recent anecdotes on successful prosecutions -- including life for meth dealers -- and lab seizures. ·
D1			The report also discusses state and local cooperation, law enforcement training, treatment, meth awareness campaign, improved efforts from Mexico (1 ton of precursor chemicals seized last year), and precursor chemicals.
D1			    2. Update on Operation Drug TEST not ready. The report on drug testing still needs considerable work. Problems include: (1) more than a year later, not all 25 cities bave program r11nninq (only 19); (2) no numbers/impact to reporJ.i (3) mostly a re-hash of original EO and proposed guidelines -­ essentially o anecdotes; and (4) does not address issue of  treatment -- to what extent are we treating offenders that test positive?
D1			"Rec: Play up the meth report and Treasury's GTO; hold the drug testing report. Also, get with DOJ on improving the criminal justice drug testing/treatment report. It's too important an anti-drug and crime initiative to get such short shrift. Here are some initial thoughts on improving the report: • ,1 ? (1) Focus on cost-benefit of testing/treatment, along the lines of new RAND report; (2) broaden to - '-'""'-,. include state and local efforts, like crime bill-funded ""drug courts""; and (3) included new actions with reports -- Drug Testing Czar (in Dennis memo)? Directive/guidelines for states to adopt c6mprehensTve testing/treatment? Push for testing/treatment dollars in juvie bill? Release of drug court funds? I follow-up on these and check DB's files for more. I know he was talking to Mark Kleiman about some ideas."

T0			" MAYORS' SUMMIT ON DRUGS Questions and Answers May 21, 1997 ;   """"-""'Clb"
D0			Methamphetamine Report
D0			Q.  What does today's report say?
D0			A.      Today's report provides an update of the Administration's National Methamphetamine Strategy and make two key findings: (1) that methamphetamine use is down in 8 key cities; and (2) that clandestine lab seizures by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) are up 170% in 1996. The Justice Department  report  cites 1996 data  which shows that in eight western cities --Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Omaha, Phoenix, Portland, San Diego, and San Jose-- methamphetamine use declined between 7 and 52% from 1995 levels.
D0			Moreover, the report shows that our strategy is being aggres·sively implemented and showing results. We've worked with Congress to strengthen penalties for meth trafficking and established new controls over precursor chemicals used to manufacture meth. U.S. Attorneys -- working with coalitions of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies -- are successfully prosecuting methamphetamine, including lifetime sentences for certain convicted methamphetamine traffickers. Federal agencies are working to increase information about the dangers of meth. They're producing meth-specific education and prevention materials, hosting local conferences and training local law enforcement.
D0			Q.  What is methamphetamine? Why is it so dangerous?
D0			A.  Methamphetamine is a synthetic stimulant drug that creates extreme aggressiveness among chronic users. The violence-prone, irrational, and aggressive behavior associated with methamphetamine usage make it an especially volatile drug. Meth can be snorted, smoked, injected, or ingested orally. The effects of methamphetamine can last anywhere from 4 to 24 hours, while the effect of cocaine is measured in minutes. The crash that occurs with the tapering off of methamphetamine's effects is often potentially psychologically disastrous.
D0			Additionally, clandestine laboratories that manufacture methamphetamine pose an environmental and safety hazard, as toxic wastes are frequently dumped on the ground or into waterways, as well as the enormously high risk of a fire or explosion. Anyone near a meth manufacturing lab is in drugsumm.qa3    Page 2-j potential danger, and cleanup costs, per lab, run into thousands of dollars.
D0			Q.  How much does methamphetamine cost?
D0			"A. A gram of methamphetamine can begin at $50. For comparison purposes, a gram of cocaine costs about $100. For this reason, meth is often referred to as the ""poor man's cocaine."""
D0			Q.  How serious is the methamphetamine problem?
D0			A.      The methamphetamine problem is serious and spreading. In recent years, use of the drug has spread from the West to the Midwest. As a result, meth-related emergency room episodes doubled between 1991 and 1994, and the number of meth-related deaths tripled. Seizures of clandestine laboratories and along the Southwest border also increased during this time period.
D0			More importantly, methamphetamine is a triple killer and extremely dangerous: First, it is a cheap, highly addictive, long-lasting stimulant that often induces violent behavior; Second, labs used to manufacture meth present a high risk of fire or explosion, endangering nearby residents; and third, the toxic wastes produced by meth labs are often dumped on the ground and in waterways, posing an environmental threat to entire communities.
D0			Q.      Why are you only providing meth data for 9 cities? Is there data on other cities?
D0			A.      The Drug Use Forecasting System collects meth data for 23 cities across the country. The methamphetamine use amongst the arrestees tested in the other 14 cities was so low, it was determined to be insignificant. By insignificant, we mean less than one percent.
D0			Q.  Doesn't the drop in the numbers for methamphetamine mean that·we're just generating hysteria about methamphetamine when the problem is really disappearing?
D0			A.      Not at all. I am very encouraged by the new, lower numbers. But we are just turning the corner. Now is not the time to  let  up.  The numbers  show  that when we work hard,  we  can have  some effect. Now,  we've got to redouble that effort and help to prevent the  spread  of  this dangerous  drug to  the eastern part of the U.S.
D0			    Q. If illegal drugs are such a big problem, then why didn't your new anti-gang bill contain new drug provisions? Idrugsumm.qa3   Page 3)
D0			        A. Our juvenile crime bill does contain increased penalties for people who sell drugs to kids and use kids to sell drugs. But we should keep in mind that existing federal drug laws are already pretty tough. Trafficking can carry up to  a life sentence.    ·
D0			But we also need to do is to make sure that local prosecutors have more resources to go after the gangs that pedal drugs to our kids. Our juvenile crime  bill  does that, too. ·
T0			Additionally, our anti-gang strategy calls for expanding after school programs. This will not only help us cut crimes when kids would be otherwise unsupervised, it will help schools get the message out that gangs, guns and drugs are dangerous.
T0			Q.      Mr. President, despite the 1994 Crime Act and tough drug laws, federal statistics show enormous increases in drug use among teenagers. Don't these figures show that you have failed and that you are taking the wrong approach?
D0			A.      I am deeply disturbed by the current trends in teenage drug use. General McCaffrey, the Attorney General and I have spent a great deal of time on this issue. That's why I've proposed a national media campaign, leveraged with private sector resources, to reach the 68 million kids at risk in this country.
D0			That's also why we need more programs to stop crimes and drug use from happening in the first place. We need a place for young people to go in those hours after school when they are unsupervised. If we don't, they may just wind up on a street corner using drugs or getting involved in delinquent or criminal activity. I've asked Congress to provide funds for after-school programs and for programs for at -risk youths-- so we could keep kids off the streets and out of trouble. I was disappointed that the House didn't include these provisions in its juvenile crime bill, but I'm hopeful that we'li be successful in the Senate.
D0			Money Laundering
D0			Q:  Could you briefly describe the proposed regulations on money  laundering?
D0			A:  When I learned of the successes of the New York Geographic Targeting Order (GTO) in dramatically reducing the flow of narcotics proceeds to Columbia, I asked the Treasury Department to examine ways to extend the GTO nationally.     • c     drugsumm.qa3    Page 4]1
D0			"Today's regulations are a response to my request. There are three proposed rules which will be published today.  The most  fundamental  of  these proposals is to register ""money services businesses"" generally,  which includes money transmitters or remitter, money order issuers and sellers, travelers check issuers and sellers, retail currency exchanges, and check cashers."
D0			The second proposed regulation  would  extend  the  suspicious  activity reporting requirements  -  already  in  place  with respect to banks - to money transmitters and issuers, sellers and redeemers of traveler's checks or money orders.
D0			The final proposed regulation essentially makes the New York GTO apply nation-wide and on a permanent basis. Under the proposed rule, money transmitters would be required to report currency transactions of $750 or more that involve the transmission of funds to any person outside of the United States. The rule also requires the remitters to verify the identity of the person sending the funds.
D0			Q:  When will these proposed regulations become effective?
D0			A:      There will be a 90-day comment period that begins today. We will then review the comments and make any appropriate changes to the rules. Once that is complete, we will publish the final rule. We hope to  do this by January 1, 1998.
D0			Therules regarding suspicious activity reporting and the new $750 reporting threshold will take effect 30 days after the final rules are published. Money services businesses will have 180 days from publication of the final rules to register with FinCEN.
D0			Q:  What are the current reporting requirements for sending money transmissions outside the U.S.?
D0			A:  Currently, no record has to be kept for any transmission under $3,000. For transmissions of $3,000 or more, the money transmitter must keep a record of the transmission. For transmissions of $10,000 or more, the money transmitter must fill out a Currency Transaction Report or CTR and file it with the IRS.
D0			Q:  Why the $750 threshold?
D0			A:      Our experience with the El Dorado Task Force indicates that most legitimate money transmissions are between $250 and $500, and that most of the ,. ·:  ijdrugsumm.qa3  Page 5] abuse by money launderers occurs above this level. Thus, we made the threshold $750 so as to exclude the majority of legitimate businesses from reporting requirements.
D0			Q:  Money transmitters are used primarily by people who do not have bank accounts -the poor and immigrants. Isn't it then discriminatory to have a $750 threshold for transmitters and not banks?
D0			A:      We do not believe the proposed regulations are discriminatory. The $750 amount applies to wires purchased in cash that are sent anywhere outside the United States. We did not focus on any particular country or region.
D0			Also, these regulations do not prevent anyone from wiring money anywhere. You can pay cash to send $100,000 to Colombia tomorrow, so long as you fill out a form and provide a photo ID. The proposed rules are designed to stop the abuse of the money transmitter industry by criminals by collecting information, not to prevent legitimate transactions.
D0			Banks are already subject to extensive regulation. Today's proposed rules are intended to deal with a relatively unregulated area of the financial services industry -  the money services businesses.
D0			GENERAL DRUG POLICY QUESTIONS
D0			    a. Why do you think spending $175 million on an ad campaign will reduce drug use    among our youth?
D0			A.      The central challenge we face is to reverse the surge in youth drug rates-­ this is the focus of my 1997 National Drug Control Strategy and it is the primary concern of the mayors. My targeted anti-drug advertising campaign-­ which would involve about 1 percent of the federal counterdrug budget-­ holds the promise to change our youth's relaxed attitudes toward drugs. We have 68 million kids who are vulnerable to drugs. It is imperative ·that we get our kids accurate information about drugs.
D0			Q.      What do you think of the Sentencing Commission's recommendations on penalties for crack and powder cocaine?
D0			A.      Last month, I commended the Sentencing Commission for moving forward with recommendations to Congress to reduce the di_sparity between crack and powder cocaine penalties. My Administration will give them very serious consideration.  I have asked Attorney General Reno and General Mccaffrey to review the Sentencing Commission's recommendations and report back to me by the end of June.     • l[drugsumm.qa3    Page6]
D0			"However, I continue to believe that our sentencing laws must reflect that crack cocaine is a more harmful form of cocaine. The Sentencing Commission's new recommendations do so. Trafficking in crack, and the violence it fosters, has a devastating impact on communities across ""America, and any changes in penalties must ensure that more dangerous offenders receive tougher sentences."
D0			Q.      Isn't the National Action Plan put forward by the Mayors essentially a  criticism of your Administration's drug policy? Doesn't it call for more funds and different actions to be taken?
D0			"    A. I don't think so. On the contrary, I think the Mayors' Action Plan is complementary to our own National Drug Strategy. Both of our plans share the same number one priority: that drug use amongst our kids must be reduced. Both of our plans call for a comprehensive drug strategy that includes enforcement, treatment, prevention and education. And both of our plans recognize the importance of responding to the country's growing methamphetamine problem -- as well as cracking down on money laundering. While some of the details vary, are plans are largely similar. 05/19/97    12:07 .... ti-' --· ...... .,,-- ,· ,, """

T0			DRAFT
D0			NATIONAL METHAMPHETAMINE STRATEGY UPDATE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
D0			In April 1996, the Administration released the National Methamphetamine Strategy, which assessed the threat and outlined an action plan for efforts to reduce the spread of methamphetamine.    Since that time, the Administration has significantly enhanced its efforts to combat methamphetamine abuse and trafficking. While some progress has been made, we need to maintain our vigilance in the effort.
D0			The Methamphetamine Problem:    Methamphetamine is a dangerous synthetic stimulant drug that can create extreme aggressiveness among chronic users; it is cheaper than cocaine and produces a longer high.  Use of the drug has historically been concentrated in the West and Southwest, but there are indications that its popularity is spreading to the Midwest and eastward.   The clandestine laboratories that manufacture methamphetamine pose an environmental risk and public safety hazard, as toxic wastes are frequently dumped on the ground or into waterways.
D0			Legislation:    Based upon the Administration's initiative and persistence, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996 last October.    The Act strengthens criminal penalties for methamphetamine trafficking and establishes new controls over precursor chemicals.
D0			"Law Enforcement:    The Administration has significantly stepped up its efforts in methamphetamine law enforcement, particularly with respect to the Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Task Force [""OCDETF""] efforts and the establishment of a Midwest High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area [""HIDTA""].  As of September 1996, all U.S. Attorneys have provided district plans assessing the current threat and ways to address it, and establishing coordination groups among community agencies and groups. Numerous methamphetamine cases have been successfully investigated and prosecuted by federal agencies, in close coordination with the state and local law enforcement agencies."
D0			Prevention and Education:   The Department of Education is conducting meetings to assess the need for a prevention and education strategy on methamphetamine and will send guidance to local schools to reduce methamphetamine use. A $10 million fund has been authorized from the Forfeiture Fund for methamphetamine reduction activities, and requests are currently being reviewed.
D0			Treatment:  As of today, there is no specific treatment protocol for methamphetamine; however, the Administration is funding the study of users' behavior patterns to formulate appropriate protocols.
D1			Data Collection:    The National Institute of Justice's Drug Use Forecasting Report is due to be released in May 1997, which will include substantial data on methamphetamine abuse.    The National Institutes of Health is also conducting an in-depth study of the methamphetamine user and will present its preliminary findings at a national conference.
D1			Conferences:    More than 400 people from all over the country and many diverse disciplines have participated (or will participate) in methamphetamine conferences to share information, increase understanding, and propose recommendations to improve the nation's response to the methamphetamine problem.
D1			Publications:       The Office of National Drug Control Policy published two documents in January 1997 on methamphetamine Pulse Check:  Methamphetamine Trends in Five Western States and Hawaii and Recent DAWN Data on Methamphetamine and Speed. The next edition will be released later this month.
D0			REPORT ON METHAMPHETAMINE ABUSE AND TRAFFICKING IN THE UNITED STATES:   An Update of the National Methamphetamine Strategy
D0			"    I. Introduction. The trafficking and abuse of methamphetamine -- a highly destructive, addictive and violence-causing synthetic drug -­ continues to be a national problem.  Methamphetamine, also known on the street as ""crank,,.. ""ice,"" and ""speed,"" is a dangerous synthetic stimulant that results in an addiction cycle and physiological trauma· similar to that associated with ""era.ck"" cocaine use.   Methamphetamine may be injected, smoked, snorted, or ingeste.d orally, making it increasingly attractive to casual users."
D0			        A. Historical Background.
D0			"Until the early 1990s, methamphetamine was largely associated with motorcycle gangs who supplied users in various parts of the United States.   Available data show that in the last few years, methamphetamine abuse has risen significantly in the West and Southwest portions of the country.    The Drug Use Forecasting [""DUF""] statistics (released in July 1996) confirmed that methamphetamine use was highest in western and southwestern locales. According to the Drug Abuse Warning Network [""DAWN""], between 1989 and 1995, the estimated number of nationwide emergency-room drug abuse episodes involving methamphetamine     • doubled, and between 1991 and 1994, the number of methamphetamine deaths nearly tripled."
D0			"The methamphetamine problem has been spreading into the Midwest and eastward into states such as Arkansas, Georgia, and Florida.    For example, in 1996, the Drug Enforcement Administration [""DEA""] seized 236 clandestine methamphetamine laboratories in Missouri."
D0			Well-organized poly-drug organizations with roots in the Mexican communities on both sides of the border have seized control of methamphetamine trafficking, using sophisticated chemical procurement, manufacturing and transportation techniques. The emergence of the Mexican drug trafficking organizations and their extensive involvement in methamphetamine production and distribution has re-defined the nature of the problem in the United States.   According to the El Paso Intelligence Center, the amount of methamphetamine seized along the southwest border increased dramatically in recent years -­ nearly 100-fold between 1992 and 1994.
D0			Unlike the cocaine business where Mexican traffickers are forced to rely upon their Colombian counterparts as primary suppliers, the Mexican organizations need n?t depend upon outside sources to manufacture methamphetamine. Once the precursor chemicals are obtained, Mexican organizations control all links of the entire production, transportation, and distribution chains -- and therefore, unfortunately, gain virtually all of the illicit profits. The Mexican organizations that dominate wholesale methamphetamine trafficking are capable of producing unprecedented quantities of high-purity methamphetamine in large­ scale laboratories.
D0			Methamphetamine also poses a unique public health and environmental hazard because of the nature of its manufacturing process.  The toxic properties associated with chemicals in and around methamphetamine laboratories introduce special health risks to law enforcement agents and the neighboring public; the incendiary and explosive nature of these chemicals further adds to the public safety risks.  These hazards and challenges warrant special precautions and training.
D0			        B. The Administration's Response.
D0			As a result of this growing methamphetamine threat, in February 1996, the Administration organized and coordinated a National Methamphetamine Conference in Arlington, Virginia to raise the public awareness of the increasing problem.    Over 200 representatives from federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies nationwide participated in the Conference, and for three days, experts shared their experiences, successes, and setbacks in their fight against methamphetamine.
D0			"In response to the methamphetamine threat, the President released the National Methamphetamine Strategy [the ""Strategy""] in April 1996. The Strategy assesses the methamphetamine threat, identifies the issues, and draws an action plan to avert the spread of methamphetamine, which, if unchecked, would become a national scourge."
D0			"The Strategy incorporates many of the recommendations from a broad spectrum of the law enforcement community.   It also recognizes that in order to tackle the methamphetamine and precursor chemicals problem, the Government must adopt a multi­ disciplinary approach, including legislation, law enforcement, training, chemical regulation, international cooperation, environmental protection, education, and treatment. Therefore, the Strategy called upon the collective wealth of experience and expertise of the Departments of Defense, Education, Health and Human Services, Justice, State, Treasury, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Office of National Drug Control Policy [""ONDCP""], and other noted experts and scholars."
D0			    II. The Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996.
D0			"Based upon the Administration's initiative and persistence, Congress took an important step when it enacted the Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996 [the ""Act""), which was signed into law on October 3, 1996.    The Act includes many elements that had been suggested in the National Methamphetamine Strategy, including increased penalties and regulatory provisions for precursor chemicals."
D1			"Specifically, the Act directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to increase penalties for trafficking in methamphetamine and its precursor chemicals to reflect the nature of such offenses, their relative harm to society, and the need for aggressive law enforcement action.   It also requests that the Commission consider significant penalty enhancements for laboratory operators who mishandle ignitable, corrosive, reactive, and toxic chemicals so as to pose a risk to public safety and the environment.    The Department of Justice [""DOJ""] is attempting to ensure that the Sentencing Commission's Guidelines, currently in the drafting phase, reflect the legislative intent to increase penalties substantially for methamphetamine offenses."
D1			The Act includes tighter controls on retail sales of drug products containing key precursor chemicals:  ephedrine, pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine.  Because methamphetamine must be synthesized from precursor chemicals, regulatory control of a select group of chemicals can impede clandestine production of the drug.
D0			    III. Methamphetamine:   A Top Law Enforcement Priority.
D1			The Administration continues to place methamphetamine enforcement efforts as a top priority.    We must continue our cooperative partnerships among federal, state, and local agencies and organizations.   There should be continued frank and candid conversations to discuss openly the difficulties faced by each region of the country.
D1			In 1996, at the request of the Attorney General, each U.S. Attorney assessed the methamphetamine problem in her/his district and together with the federal, state, and local agencies, came up with a plan to address the problem.  In some cases -- particularly, in the Midwest and California -- the U.S. Attorneys developed regional strategies.
D1			In addition, law enforcement agencies continue to develop intelligence and information on trafficking organizations and clandestine laboratories to assist in the monitoring of shipments of methamphetamine and its precursor chemicals -- with a special emphasis on major violent methamphetamine trafficking organizations. Based upon this information, federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies are selecting and pursuing the highest-level and most dangerous targets.
D1			 In addition, the Administration is addressing public safety issues connected with the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine. The environmental dangers presented by manufacturers of methamphetamine and the explosive potentialities pose significant hazards to private citizens and law enforcement personnel.
D0			 One sad example of the dangers of methamphetamine production occurred in Perris, California on April 19, 1997, when a fire exploded in a trailer home seriously burning two young children, ages 4 and 6. The investigators determined that the fire was caused by the mother of the two children attempting to extract pseudoephedrine from certain pharmaceutical tablets.  The mother was subsequently arrested on suspicion of manufacturing methamphetamine and four counts of child endangerment, and more than 1,400 bottles of pseudoephedrine were recovered from the scene. Such dangers must be addressed -- not only by law enforcement authorities -- but also in cooperation with public health and safety officials.
D1			        A. Drug Enforcement Administration Initiatives.
D1			 The DEA, in particular, has demonstrated its commitment to combat the spread of methamphetamine trafficking and abuse by undertaking significant law enforcement and educational efforts. DEA Clandestine Laboratory Enforcement Teams seized 879 clandestine methamphetamine laboratories -- 2.7 times the number seized (326) in 1995.    Current projections indicate that an even higher number of seizures will be achieved in 1997. [DEA map on lab seizures. 1 ]
D1			1   The above chart represents the laboratory seizures in which the DEA assisted or participated; it does not, however, account for the numerous law enforcement actions by the state and local authorities.    ·
D0			In addition, DEA's Special Operations Division, since April 1996, has funded or assisted in approximately 80 major methamphetamine investigations of Mexican targets.   Many of these investigations involve the use of extensive court-authorized electronic surveillance and other sophisticated investigative techniques.
D0			 DEA has also provided substantial support to state and local law enforcement agencies in combatting the distribution of methamphetamine on our streets.   The DEA Domestic.Operations Section established a Special Enforcement Program entitled Operation VELOCITY which targets major methamphetamine organizations, as well as independent traffickers in the United States.
D1			" Moreover, the DEA Office of Diversion Control established a priority targeting system named Operation BACKTRACK which targets rogue chemical companies that supply clandestine methamphetamine laboratories.   Also, DEA, in conjunction with the California Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement [""BNE""), the Western State Intelligence Network, and the El Paso Intelligence Center, continues to work to establish a National Clandestine Laboratory Data Base, which will assist all law enforcement agencies in methamphetamine investigations and provide a national perspective on clandestine laboratories, based upon input from all law enforcement agencies.    DEA has formulated plans to purchase new safety equipment, such as air monitors, air purified respirators, laboratory trucks, fire-resistant clothing, and other tactical clothing for DEA agents and state and local officers who raid clandestine laboratories."
D0			        B. Successful Prosecutions.
D0			. United States Attorneys around the nation continue to acknowledge methamphetamine as a growing threat.   Numerous
D0			". There are two primary factors which contribute to the large increase in DEA seizures of methamphetamine laboratories --     (1) the spread eastward of clandestine laboratory activity; and     (2) the enhanced attention by law enforcement around the country. The spread eastward of methamphetamine manufacturers can.be attributed, in large part,·to the growth of small entrepreneurs using the ""Nazi"" method"" to produce small batches of methamphetamine (four ounces or less).   Their source of precursor chemicals frequently is pseudoephedrine tablets purchased at local retail outlets; approximately 680 tablets of pseudoephedrine yield one ounce of finished methamphetamine. methamphetamine cases have been investigated and prosecuted by federal agencies in close coordination and cooperation with the state and local law enforcement agencies, and many others have been prosecuted by local District Attorney's Offices throughout the country."
D0			. Indeed, in 1996, a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area was designated by the Administration for a five-state region in the Midwest. This HIDTA will address the problem of methamphetamine use, production, and trafficking in Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and South Dakota.
D0			. Of the many successful federal methamphetamine prosecutions, a few are summarized below:
D0			Life Sentence Imposed On Convicted Methamphetamine Trafficker.  On April 24, 1997, in the Eastern District of Washington, a federal court, for the first, imposed a life sentence upon a defendant convicted of charges relating to his methamphetamine manufacturing and distribution operations in Burns, Oregon and Alberta, Canada. Co-defendants received sentences of 30-year prison terms.       The convictions culminated a seven-month joint investigation involving the DEA, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Harney County [Oregon] Sheriffs Office, Oregon State Police, and Lassen County [California] Narcotics Task Force.
D0			Methamphetamine Trafficker Convicted.   On April 4, 1997, in the Southern District of Texas, a defendant was convicted on four counts charging various methamphetamine offenses, including possession with intent to distribute 136 grams of methamphetamine and his attempt to possess more than BOO grams of 98% pure methamphetamine.
D0			Drug Transporters Indicted Following Largest Methamphetamine Seizure in the U.S.    On November 12, 1996, 11 defendants were indicted in the District of New Mexico, following the February 1995 seizure of almost 700 pounds of methamphetamine and 200 pounds of marijuana.   Two of the defendants are charged as principal administrators of a continuing criminal enterprise, the drug kingpin statute that is reserved for the highest echelon of participants within a drug trafficking organization.    The methamphetamine and marijuana, which originated in Juarez, Mexico, had been packed into molded fiberglass containers and loaded into the trailer at a warehouse in El Paso, and was being transported to Chicago.   This OCDETF investigation was conducted by agents of the DEA and U.S. Customs Service, as part of the Southwest Border Initiative.
D0			        ◦ Chemical Sales Company Owner Sentenced for Illicit Sale of Methamphetamine Precursor Chemicals.   On September 17, 1996, in the Western District of Texas, a defendant was sentenced to a significant term of imprisonment for possessing with intent to distribute 25 kilograms of phenylacetic acid, a precursor chemical used in the production of methamphetamine.  The defendant, an owner of a small chemical sales company in El Paso, was arrested as he attempted to sell the phenylacetic acid to a DEA informant.
D0			"        ◦ Largest Methamphetamine Trafficking Organization in Southeastern New Mexico Taken Down.   On July 17, 1996, in the District of New Mexico, 26 individuals were charged in a 28-count indictment alleging a conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine and related firearms charges, as well as forfeiture allegations against three pieces of land valued at more than $8,000,000.   The principal administrator of this organization and several of his family members were engaged in operating a continuing criminal enterprise. The organization, centered in Roswell, New Mexico, was responsible for transporting 500 pounds of methamphetamine from California to New Mexico. This OCDETF investigation was conducted by law enforcement agents from DEA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation [""FBI""], U.S. Marshals Service, New Mexico State Police, Roswell Police Department, and Artesia Police Department."
D0			        C. Joint Task Force and Working Group Efforts.
D1			 In accordance with the Administration's goals of maintaining an open dialogue on methamphetamine concerns, several working groups and task forces have been established to share information and discuss pending issues.    Following a methamphetamine·strategy meeting sponsored by DEA and BNE in May 1996 in Sacramento, California, two working groups were established to address improvements in investigative approaches to methamphetamine cases and prepare a model for successful investigation and prosecution of rogue chemical company targets.
D1			" The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of California has formed a precursor chemicals working group [the ""Precursor Committee""), primarily involving the districts that form the new OCDETF Southwest Region, in close coordination with the DOJ Criminal Division and the DEA Diversion Division. Among its goals is to develop a priority list of targeted chemical corporations that are suspected of trafficking in precursor chemicals.   The Precursor Committee has also prepared an Investigative Techniques and Prosecution Tactics Outline Regarding Rogue Chemical Companies and facilitated intelligence sharing among agencies and prosecutors."
D1			" The second group, the California Prosecutors Working Group, consists of Assistant U.S. Attorneys [""AUSAs"") from the four judicial districts in California and Deputy District Attorneys from selected California District Attorney's Offices.   The Working Group is addressing the following:  (1) discovery and ethical issues associated with methamphetamine laboratory cases in which hidden transponder devices are utilized; (2) responses to common defenses utilized in methamphetamine and precursor chemical cases; and (3) successful use of sentencing enhancements in state and federal prosecutions."
D1			 The Southwest Border Methamphetamine Contacts Group, consisting of AUSAs from each of the relevant districts, will facilitate coordination of inter-district investigations of rogue chemical companies.    The San Diego County Methamphetamine Strike Force, composed of community leaders from 70 federal, state, and local agencies from law enforcement, health services, state courts, and drug treatment centers, has developed an action plan in the areas of interdiction, prevention, intervention, and treatment.
D0			        D. Education and Training.
D1			. The Administration believes that the unique sensitivities surrounding the methamphetamine problem warrant special training and awareness.  In addition, DOJ's Advocacy Institute and Office of Legal Education have developed and offered a course on methamphetamine prosecutions.    This course covered the operations of methamphetamine laboratory, distribution patterns of methamphetamine, search and seizure issues, precursor chemicals regulations, pro-active investigations, and prosecutive strategies.  Training sessions continue to be coordinated by the U.S. Attorneys from the Southern District of California and the District of Nebraska to share techniques and lessons learned with prosecutors in the Midwest districts.
D1			 In addition, DEA has nearly doubled the number of clandestine laboratory certification training schools offered to state and local law enforcement from seven in FY 1996 to 13 in FY 1997 and established two remote training sites in San Diego and Kansas City.   These schools will provide training for 520 local officers this year.
D1			 Furthermore, DEA is reviewing the possibility of additional chemical hazards training for law enforcement agents, especially in light of the toxic and flammability risks involved. For instance, in March 1997, a DEA Special Agent in Blackburn, Missouri inhaled some dangerous acidic fumes in a raid on a clandestine methamphetamine laboratory; the agent suffered some minor burns to the nostril area and was taken to the hospital for treatment.
D1			 DEA has funded a 24-hour methamphetamine hotline in its San Diego Field Division to provide law enforcement, treatment, and preventive services to San Diego County at no cost. DEA has also joined forces with organizations -- such as the Partnership for a Drug Free America and other entities representing prevention, law enforcement, treatment, and medical professionals -- to provide information and lectures on substance abuse to communities throughout the United States.   DEA's Operation VELOCITY is producing a videotape production to educate law enforcement officers on some of the chemical hazards of clandestine laboratory investigations.  Clandestine laboratory awar.eness posters are being distributed to state and local clandestine laboratory enforcement teams throughout the United States.
D1			 Two Methamphetamine Conferences have been scheduled to assess progress and solicit input from the States for revision of the National Methamphetamine Strategy. The first, a western regional conference, was held on January 12-13, 1997 in San Francisco, California. This Conference was co-hosted by Senator Feinstein, and over 160 persons participated from six states; it was well-received.    The second Conference will take place on May 28-30, 1997 in Omaha, Nebraska and will be co-hosted by Senator Kerrey.
D1			" These Conferences bring together policy makers, researchers, public interest groups, law enforcement, treatment, and prevention specialists to share information, increase understanding, and make recommendations on improving the nation's strategic response to this growing problem.    The Attorney General, Director of the National Institute of Justice [""NIJ""], and the Director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse [""NIDA""] will address this National Conference."
D0			    IV. International Efforts.
D1			Mexico-based organizations are now predominant in methamphetamine and precursor chemicals trafficking.  The Administration has been advising and training our foreign counterparts -- particularly in Mexico -- and on ways to curb methamphetamine trafficking.    They have been encouraged to implement meaningful controls to prevent smuggling and diversion of precursor chemicals.   Further, the Administration has been augmenting the role of the existing U.S.-Mexico working group on precursor chemicals, which oversees the training of Mexican officials and the mechanics of the exchange of chemical information with Mexico.
D0			    V. Demand Reduction Efforts.
D0			        A. Education and Prevention.
D1			 The Administration continues to stress the need for public awareness with respect to the methamphetamine threat.    All segments of our society -- including law enforcement, teachers, judges, social workers, and public health officials -- should learn about the hazards posed by this drug and should proclaim its dangers to America's youth.
D1			 DOJ has worked to launch the Methamphetamine Interagency Task Force, to examine the best ways to reduce demand of methamphetamine, as required by the Act.  This Task Force which will bring together experts from all over the country to design, implement, and evaluate the education, prevention, and treatment practices and strategies of the Federal government with respect to methamphetamine and other synthetic stimulants.
D0			        B. Collection Of Dat .
D1			"The NIJ is also expanding its DUF program from 23 to over 40 sites in 1997, and the program will be renamed the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring [""ADAM""].    This program is important in tracking the spread of an emerging drug like methamphetamine and will  · provide timely data about drug trends from a select population. The next DUF Report on methamphetamine use is due to be released in May 1997."
D1			The Administration's Operation DRUGTEST .is being implemented with the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. Twenty-five federal districts have agreed to test arrestees for drug use -- in most cases, prior to the arrestee's first appearance before a judicial officer.  The Administration hopes to expand this drug testing, sanctions, and treatment program to an additional 25 districts in 1998.
D0			        C. Treatment Protocol for Methamphetamine Abuse.
D0			As of today, there is no specific treatment protocol for methamphetamine.   Because chronic methamphetamine users frequently suffer major changes in neural chemical activity and brain functions, treatment periods for methamphetamine users can be much longer and more extensive than treatments for other abused drugs.
D1			 Administration personnel are continuing to work with medical researchers and treatment practitioners to understand the behaviors that threaten law enforcement and the measures that will be taken to restrain and not further injure the user. Government authorities have participated in public health conferences to determine the direction that medical and scientific research should take with respect to physical and chemical effects of methamphetamine, medical complications associated with its abuse, and treatment and prevention methods.
D1			 In addition, NIJ has begun to formulate a demonstration plan that would test drug treatment protocols for methamphetamine­ involved persons in the criminal justice systems.    Drawing upon the expertise of drug treatment professionals, NIJ hopes to support the development of effective methamphetamine treatment technologies as the criminal justice system confronts the continuing challenges of drugs and crime.
D0			NIDA held a research conference in June 1996 to study treatment.    NIDA research has dramatically increased our knowledge about the neural basis for psycho-stimulant drugs like methamphetamine and the neuro-toxic potential of these stimulants.        Methamphetamine has been shown to be a powerfully addictive stimulant causing physical and behavioral changes. NIDA currently supports $20 million in research to understand the epidemiology of methamphetamine use, its mechanism of action and effects on brain functions, behavioral consequences of methamphetamine, and treatment and prevention implications and approaches.
D0			"NIDA is also supporting research entitled ""Integrating Treatments for Methamphetamine Abuse:    A Psychosocial Perspective.""    Their findings suggest that there is a measurable degree of response by methamphetamine abusers to psychosocial· intervention and that the general treatment experience, as reflected by the attendance of therapeutic sessions, breaks in treatment participation, and total treatment received does not differ significantly between methamphetamine and cocaine users."
D1			"The National Institutes of Health [""NIH""] similarly are conducting an in-depth study of the methamphetamine user and will present its preliminary findings at a national conference.    NIH also plans to expand its drug testing program to improve data collection."
D1			"Furthermore, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [""SAMHSA""] has two major proposals to investigate the implications of methamphetamine abuse. The first proposal will evaluate the effects of methamphetamine on pregnancy and post-natal development; this type of information is currently obtained anecdotally.    The proposed project will examine retrospectively the association of methamphetamine use during pregnancy with the medical and developmental consequences found among two cohorts of pre-natally methamphetamine-exposed children born in 1989 and 1990.        SAMHSA's second project will study the effects on suppressing methamphetamine demand at the community level with intensified drug-testing in the criminal justice system and at the workplace, combined with media campaigns and enhanced treatment for methamphetamine dependence."
D1			These efforts are important because they will facilitate our understanding of how the behavior of methamphetamine users may endanger herself/himself, others in the home or the immediate community, and law enforcement personnel. Greater knowledge about the characteristics of methamphetamine users and the ability to identify them is important because investigative and prosecutive decisions may be. affected if a defendant, a witness, or an informant has a drug abuse problem.
D0			    VI. Successes of Administration's Efforts.
D1			The Administration believes that its vigorous efforts have led to a moderation in the trend of methamphetamine trafficking and abuse, based upon the same statistical criteria previously used. Initial reports from available statistical data indicate that methamphetamine use have shown a slight decline.  [ONDCP will provide recent DUF and DAWN figures which presumably show that methamphetamine use has decreased in all cities, except San Antonio. These figures are due out in May.).
D1			Therefore, our continued efforts must remain vigilant and should be fortified.  We must be cautious not to relax such efforts, because our goals and objectives are not yet accomplished.   We need to continue a comprehensive assault against the dangers associated with methamphetamine production, distribution, trafficking, and abuse.
D1			    VII. Increased Resources Requested.
D1			To demonstrate the Administration's continued efforts to combat the methamphetamine problem, it has requested significant additional resources be devoted to the threat.    A significant portion of the methamphetamine trafficking is occurring along the Southwest border.
D1			"As part of the Administration's Southwest Border Initiative [""SWBI""), many DOJ components received significant resource enhancements in FY 1997.    The SWBI targets trafficking groups that manufacture and distribute methamphetamine as well as other drugs. In FY 1998 request, the U.S. Attorneys, DEA, and FBI are requesting a total of 359 positions [146 agents and 41 attorneys) and $46.8 million as part of the SWBI.   A significant portion of these resources have helped and will continue to assist in combatting the trafficking of methamphetamine."
D1			The rise in methamphetamine trafficking has also caused an increased caseload for the U.S. Attorneys, and in response, the Administration's FY 1998 request for U.S. Attorneys includes an enhancement of 56 positions (37 attorneys) and $5,161,000 for its Narcotic and Dangerous Drug program.   In addition, the Administration is seeking three additional DOJ Criminal Division attorney positions in FY 1998 to increase its ability to coordinate and support the SWBI from headquarters.   These positions will support the Attorney General's goal to achieve enhanced centralized management of the investigations and prosecutions related to the large-scale, multi-district methamphetamine cases.
D1			With respect to DEA, the FY 1998 budget request includes an increase of 74 positions (60 agents) and $11.1 million in resources to fund a comprehensive approach to combat methamphetamine trafficking. The FBI is focusing on identifying the most significant Mexican manufacturers and distributors of methamphetamine and targeting the key command and control elements of these organizations, including key distribution networks in small- and medium-sized U.S. communities.,  In addition, the FBI focuses its resources on methamphetamine distribution elements located in problem areas, such as Omaha, St. Louis, and Jackson.
D0			    VIII. Conclusion.
D1			"The Administration is dedicated to continuing its efforts to stop the spread of methamphetamine trafficking and abuse in this country.  The Administration will continue its cooperative efforts with the U.S. Conference of Mayors [""USCM"") in contributing to their ""National Action Plan To Control Drugs."" One of their top priorities has been to increase public awareness of the methamphetamine threat, and the USCM fully supports the Administration's initiative to combat the spread of methamphetamine.    Federal authorities will continue to investigate and prosecute cases aggressively, as well as promulgate strong regulations, provide training to state and local agencies, promote public awareness of the problem, and educate and treat methamphetamine users."
