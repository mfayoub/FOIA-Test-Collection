D0			Marriage Penalties and Bonuses, and Stay-At-Home Parents
D0			Overview
D0			    • These are overlapping, but distinct, issues. Marriage penalties and bonuses affect most married couples as well as many currently urunarried individuals. The tax treatment of marriage is a very broad issue.
D0			The concern about the child care costs of stay-at-home parents is a narrower issue of primary concern to couples with young children.
D0			    • This memo has three sections: The first describes marriage penalties, why they arise, and provides examples. The second describes and analyses options for reducing marriage penalties. The third describes and analyses a few additional options specifically aimed at stay­ at-home parents.
D0			    I. What Are Marriage Penalties?
D0			        ◦ A couple that owes more income tax by filing a joint return than they would pay if they were unmarried and each filed separate returns has a marriage penalty.
D0			        ◦ Conversely, a couple that_owes less income tax by filing a joint return than they would pay if they were unmarried and each filed separate returns has a marriage bonus.
D0			        ◦ In general, couples with a stay-at-home spouse receive marriage bonuses, whereas two­ earner couples in which spouses have similar earnings face marriage penalties.
D0			Why Do Marriage Penalties and Bonuses Arise?
D0			        ◦ Marriage penalties and bonuses generally arise because the standard deduction and rate brackets for joint filers are less than twice the corresponding amounts for single filers.
D0			        ◦ For couples with children, marriage penalties may arise because a spouse could file as a head of household ifthe couple were not married.
D0			The head of household standard deduction and rates are more generous than corresponding amounts for single filers. -2-
D0			    • Marriage penalties and bonuses also arise because of other tax provisions, such as the EITC, the taxation of Social Security benefits, and the AMT exemption for which the parameters for joint filers are less than twice the corresponding amounts for single filers.
D0			Examples
D0			    • Consider four couples, each with $60,000 of earnings (and no other income). Couples A and B have no children, Couples C and D each have one child. Couples A and C have two earners, each with $30,000 of earnings. Couples B and D have one earner with $60,000 of earnings.
D0			    • The details of the tax computations for these couples are shown in the attachment.
D0			    • In summary, here is what the examples show: Two-earner Couples A and C have marriage penalties, whereas one-earner couples B and D have marriage bonuses. The marriage penalties and bonuses for the couples with a child are smaller than for the couples without a child. However, this would not be true in all circumstances. Having a child reduces Couple C's and D's tax liability significantly relative to Couples A and B, because of the additional exemption for the child, the child credit, and (for Couple C) the child and dependent care tax credit (CDCTC).
D0			How Large Are Aggregate Marriage Penalties and Bonuses?
D0			    • There are approximately $30 billion per year of marriage penalties and $34 billion per year of marriage bonuses according to a recent CBO study.
D0			    • More taxpayers have bonuses than penalties, with marriage boriuses predominating for low income families, and marriage penalties predominating for high income families, especially when there are two high earners.
D1			    II. Options for Addressing Marriage Penalties
D1			Five options for addressing marriage penalties have been discussed: a single filer option, an income splitting option, making joint tax parameters double single parameters, a two-earner deduction, and a targeted two-earner deduction or credit.
D1			        ◦ Treasury is doing more analytical work on these options.
D1			Single Filer Option (H.R. 2456 with 2 I 8 cosponsors)
D1			        ◦ Under this option, a married couple could continue to file a joint tax return, or could elect to file two separate returns, as if each were an unmarried individual.
D1			H.R. 2456 would combine separate filing on one tax return form and lessen some of the inherent complexity of separate filing by arbitrarily prorating deductions and by retaining a joint computation of the EITC and other credits.
D1			Each spouse would report their own earnings, but could reallocate their unearned income by shifting assets.
D1			Dependent exemptions would be allocated in proportion to each spouse's share of their total income (AG!).
D1			        ◦ As the examples illustrate, optional single filing would significantly reduce marriage penalties. In the examples marriage bonuses are unaffected, but in some circumstances marriage bonuses would be increased.
D1			        ◦ The examples also illustrate that married couples with identical total incomes and taxes under current law could pay quite different taxes under optional single filing (compare Couples A and B).
D1			        ◦ This option would-be very expensive, costing roughly $22 billion (in 1999 income levels) per year
D1			        ◦ This option would provide only limited or even no tax benefit to stay-at-home parents, since each spouse would report their own earned income.
D1			        ◦ Optional single filing would also substantially increase the burdens of the income tax system.  Many, if not most, married couples would have to make three, rather than one, tax computation (joint, his, and hers) in order to determine the filing method that results in the least tax liability.
D1			Currently, couples who pool their resources need not keep separate records by spouse. Under optional separate filing, separate income and deduction records could be necessary and complex rules would be needed to allocate income, deductions, credits and exemptions. -4-
D1			Income Splitting
D1			"A number of Republicans who originally supported H.R. 2456 are now advocating an even more costly approach, which would allow single filing combined with ""income splitting."" The motivation for this option is specifically to provide tax benefits to stay-at-home parents. (Senator Ashcroft's proposal includes this provision.) Under income splitting, half of a couple's income, including their earnings, would be attributed to each spouse."
D1			        ◦ As the examples illustrate, this option would allow two-earner couples to compute their tax as if they were single individuals, reducing their marriage penalties, as under the single filing option. Some two-earner couples would receive a larger tax cut (and reduction in marriage penalties) under income splitting, however, because both earned and unearned income could be split.
D1			        ◦ Income splitting would greatly increase marriage bonuses.
D1			        ◦ This option would cost roughly $36 billion (in 1999 income levels) per year.
D1			        ◦ Income splitting would add computational complexity to income tax filing, although it would not be as onerous as single filing since income would simply be split irrespective of which spouse earned the income or owned the underlying asset.
D1			Make Joint Tax Parameters Double Single Parameters
D1			Marriage penalties could be substantially reduced by making the standard deduction and rate brackets for joint filers twice the corresponding amounts for single filers.
D1			        ◦ One approach would be to increase the joint parameters to twice the current single parameters.
D1			        ◦ As illustrated by the examples, this option is basically equivalent in effect to income splitting, so would be just as expensive ($36 billion per year), and have the same effect on marriage penalties and bonuses.
D1			        ◦ However, this option would be much simpler than income splitting, since no additional computations would be required.
D1			        ◦ An alternative approach would be to reduce the single parameters to half the current joint parameters.
D1			This approach would raise revenue by increasing taxes on most single filers, without reducing taxes paid by married couples.
D1			        ◦ The Treasury reform option adopts an intermediate approach to addressing marriage -5- penalties, but also makes several other significant changes to the tax code.
D1			Tackling marriage penalties as part of a broader reform package ameliorates the stark tradeoff between two-earner couples and single taxpayers that a low-cost marriage penalty solution along these lines would require.
D0			Two-Earner Deduction (H.R. 2593, sponsored by twenty-two mostly Republican Ways and Means Committee members)
D0			This proposal would resurrect the second earner deduction that existed between 1982 and 1986. The deduction is for 10 percent of the first $30,000 of the earnings of the spouse with lesser amount of earnings.
D1			        ◦ As the examples illustrate, this option can reduce marriage penalties significantly.
D1			        ◦ This option can also increase the marriage bonuses of those already receiving marriage bonuses, or change current marriage penalties into marriage bonuses
D1			        ◦ However, this option provides no tax benefits to stay-at-home parents.
D1			        ◦ Our very preliminary revenue estimates are that this proposal would cost approximately $12 billion per year.   ·
D1			A Targeted Two-Earner Deduction or Credit (A less expensive two-earner deduction)
D1			Better targeting of a second earner deduction can be achieved by setting a percentage floor, say, 20 percent, of combined total income (not only earnings) on the second earner deduction. A tax deduction or credit could then be provided for some percentage of the amount by which the earnings of the lower-earning spouse exceed 20 percent of the couple's total income. The size of the deduction or credit can be capped, if there is a resource constraint.
D1			"        ◦ Compared with a simple second earner deduction, very little of the benefits of a targeted deduction or credit are ""wasted"" on those already receiving marriage bonuses."
D1			        ◦ As with the previous proposal, limited deductions (or credits) address the problem by providing only incomplete relief to those with very large penalties.
D1			.         ◦ One variant we have examined costs roughly $5 billion per year, though this cost could be dialed up or down depending on revenue targets.
D1			Ill. Options for Helping Stay-At-Home Parents
D1			Two options specifically designed to help stay-at-home parents have been discussed: -6- extending the CDCTC to stay-at-home parents, and providing an additional child credit for young children. Before describing and analyzing these proposals, the President's Budget proposal to expand the child and dependent care tax credit (CDCTC) is described.
D0			President's Proposal to Expand the CDCTC
D0			        ◦ Under the President's Budget proposal, the credit rate would be raised to 50 percent for parents with incomes (AG!s) of$30,000 or less. This rate would phase down by one percentage point for each $1,000 of income above $30,000 until it reached 20 percent for parents with over $59,000 of income.
D0			The President's proposal retains the requirement that both parents (the parent, in single-parent households) must work (or attend school or be fully disabled) in order to be eligible for the CDCTC.
D0			The President's proposal (including a simplification provision) would cost $5.1 billion over five yea rs.
D0			        ◦ Under this proposal, couples with incomes over $59,000 would have the same CDCTC as under current law.
D0			        ◦ However, because the credit rate is increased for incomes below $59,000, some couples would have larger marriage penalties under the President's proposal than under current law.
D0			        ◦ The President's proposal provides no tax benefits to stay-at-home parents.
D0			Extend the CDCTC to Stay-At-Home Parents
D0			        ◦ Senator Chafee has introduced a bill that would deem taxpayers with one or more children under the age of four to have incurred child care expenses of $150 per month ($1,800 per year) for purposes of the CDCTC.
D0			As under the President's proposal, the credit rate would be raised to 50 percent for parents with incomes (AG!s) of $30,000 or less.
D0			However, the 50% rate would phase down more slowly under the Chafee proposal, by one percentage point for each $1,500 of income above $30,000, until it completely phased out.
D0			        ◦ Under the Chafee proposal, couples with a stay-at-home parent could receive a CDCTC.
D0			        ◦ However, many single parents and two-earner couples with children under the age of four would also benefit from the Senator Chafee's proposal, either because they work but do -7- not pay for child care, or pay for child care but do not claim as much credit as they would be eligible for under the proposal.
D1			o   We have prepared preliminary revenue estimates for two variants of the Chafee proposal.
D1			Both variants differ from the Chafee proposal in two respects: they would apply to children under·age three (rather than age four), and both would deem minimum expenses on a per-child basis (up to two or more children).
D1			One variant would allow parents of children under the age of three to claim a deemed amount of annual child care expenses of $1,200 ($2,400 for two or more children under age three) plus actual child care expenses, up to the current law limit of $2,400 ($4,800 for two or more eligible children) for purposes of the CDCTC.
D1			This variant would cost $13.4 billion over five years ($8.5 billion more than the President's Budget proposal).
D1			A second variant would allow parents of children under the age of three to claim a deemed amount of annual child care expense of $1,200 ($2,400 for two or more children under age three), or, if more, actual child care expenses (up to the current law limit of $2,400 ($4,800 for two or more eligible children)) for purpose of the CDCTC. It would also phase the credit out at $103,500 of AGL
D1			This second variant would cost $11.4 billion over five years ($6.5 billion more than the President's Budget proposal).
D1			Provide an Additional Child Credit for Young Children
D1			o       The child credit could be increased for young children, irrespective of the work status or out-of-pocket child care expenses of the parent(s).
D1			For example, the child credit could be doubled for children under the age of one. This would make the credit for these children $1,000 beginning in 1999. This option would cost roughly $4 billion over five years.
T0			Attachment
D0			Examples of Marriage Penalties and Bonuses
D0			Measuring Marriage Penalties and Bonuses
D0			For purposes of measuring marriage penalties and bonuses, it is assumed that if a couple were unmarried each spouse would retain their earnings and would each file a separate return.
D0			If the couple has no children, the separate returns would be filed using the standard deduction and rates for single taxpayers.
D0			If the couple has one or more children, it is assumed that the spouse with higher earnings would provide a home for the child(ren) and file using the standard deduction and rates for head of household taxpayers. The other spouse would file as a single taxpayer.
D0			Couple A (Two-Earners. No Children)
D0			    • Two earners, each with $30,000 of earnings, and no other income.
D0			    • No children.

D0			o   Couple A has a marriage penalty of$879.50. If they were unmarried and each spouse filed a separate return, their combined tax liability would be $3,457.50 + $3,457.50 = $6,915.00 which is $879.50 )lli than their tax on a joint return ($7,794.50- $6,915.00 = $879.50). -2-
D0			Couple B {One Earner, No Children)

D0			    • Couple B has a marriage bonus of$3.764.00. If they were unmarried, Spouse 2 would have no tax liability, but Spouse 1 would pay $11,558.50 which is $3,764.00 more than their tax on a joint return ($7,794.50). Note that Couple B pays the same amount of tax as Couple A.
D0			Couple C {Two-Earners. One Child)
D0			    • Two earners, each with $30,000 of earnings, and no other income.
D0			    • One child, and child care expenses of $200 per month ($2,400 per year).
D0			Filing  Filing Separate Returns Joint Return Spouse  I HH Eiler Spouse 2 Single Filer Total Earnings $60,000 $30,000 $30,000 Standard Deduction 7,100 6,250 4,250 Exemptions 8,100 5,400 2,700 Taxable Income 44,800 18,350 23,050 Tax (before credits)    7,038.50    2,752.50    3,457.50 Child Credit (1998) 400.00  400.00  0
D0			    • Couple C has a marriage penalty of $828.50.  If  they were unmarried  and  Spouse  1  filed as a head of household and Spouse 2 filed as single, their combined tax liability would be $5,330.00 (= $1,872.50 + $3,457.50), which is $828.50 less than their tax on a joint return ($6, I 58.50 • $5,330.00 = $828.50).
D0			    • Couple C's marriage penalty is $51 less than if they did not have a child (Couple A).
D0			    Some couples, however, face larger marriage penalties with a child than without.
D0			    • Although Couple C still faces a marriage penalty, having a child reduces their joint return tax liability by $ I,636.00.
D0			The additional exemption for the child has a tax value of $756.00, since Couple C is in the 28% bracket (28% x $2,700 = $756.00).
D0			The child-related credits reduce Couple C's tax liability by $880.00.
D0			Couple D (One Earner, One Child)
D0			    • One earner with $60,000 of earnings, other spouse is stay-at-home, no other income.
D0			    • One child.

D0			    • Couple D has a marriage bonus of $2,086.00. If they were unmarried and Spouse I filed as a head of household (Spouse 2 would not have to file a return), their combined tax liability would be $8,724.50, which is $2,086.00 more than their tax on a joint return ($8,724.50 - $6,638.50 = $2,086.00). • -4-
D0			        ◦ Couple D's marriage bonus is $1,678.00 less than if they did not have a child (Couple B).
D0			This is because if Couple D had no children, filing separately would require Spouse I to file as single, which has a less favorable standard deduction and rates than for a head of household.
D0			        ◦ Although Couple D has a smaller marriage bonus than if they were childless, having a child reduces their joint return tax liability by $1,156.00 ($756.00 for the additional exemption and $400.00 for the child credit).
D0			        ◦ The difference in Couple C's and Couple D's joint return liability ($480.00) is due entirely to the CDCTC.
D1			Examples of Proposals to Address Marriage Penalties
D1			Single Filer Option
D1			        ◦ Under this option, a married couple could continue to file a joint tax return, or could elect to file two separate returns, as if each were an unmarried individual.
D1			Each spouse would report their own earnings.
D1			This option would change marriage penalties and bonuses as follows:     Childless Couples    Couples with One Child Couple A (Two Earners) Couple B (One Earner) Couple C (Two Earners) Couple D (One Earner) Current Penalties (Bonuses) $879.50 ($3,764.00) $828.50 ($2,086.00) Option Penalties (Bonuses) 0 ($3,764.00) 300.00 ($2,086.00) Change -879.50 0 -528.50 0
D1			        ◦ The option would eliminate Couple A's marriage penalty and reduce, but not eliminate Couple C's marriage penalty (because the option would not allow any spouse to compute their tax using the head of household standard deduction and rates).
D1			Income Splitting
D1			        ◦ This option would allow separate filing, as in the preceding option, but in addition would attribute half of a couple's total earned income to be attributed to each spouse. • -5-
D1			    • This option would change marriage penalties and bonuses as follows:     Childless Couples           Couples with One Child   Couple A (Two Earners) Couple B (One Earner) Couple C (Two Earners) Couple D (One Earner) Current Penalties (Bonuses) $879.50 ($3,764.00) $828.50 ($2,086.00) Option Penalties (Bonuses) 0 ($4,643.50) 300.00 ($2,614.50) Change -879.50 +879.50 -528.50 +528.50
D1			Make Joint Tax Parameters Double Single Parameters

T0			ASSISTANT SECRETARY DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY WASHINGTON January  30,  l 998
T0			MEMORANDUM FOR SECRETARY RUBrN
T0			FROM:   DONALD C. LUBICK ACTrNG ASSISTANT SECRETARY (TAX POLICY)
D0			SUBJECT:    Agenda for Your Monday Meeting With Chief of Staff Bowles
D1			Your meeting Monday afternoon with Erskine Bowles is to discuss tax legislative strategy: how  to move forward the Administration's proposals and defeat the Congressional proposals. A suggested agenda for the meeting, listing the key issues, is attached. This memorandum provides brief comments on each of those issues. ·
D1			    1. Congressional proposal to sunset the tax code. Administration strategy options:
D1			    • (a) Oppose. The proposal would create great uncertainty, thus likely inhibit business investment until an alternative tax system were enacted, adversely affecting the economy.
D1			"    • (b) Develop an alternative proposal to sunset only upon enactment, without gap, of a replacement tax system that is fair, promotes economic growth, provides the revenue needed to maintain budgetary discipline, and simplifies the tax system for average Americans. This will require that the Congress develop a better system than the current one before it can be. repealed. This will allow members who don't think a better system can be adopted by the Congress to vote for sunset. An alternative approach is to require the sunset proposal to include a number of""poison pills"" (such as retaining home mortgage interest deduction, charitable deduction, etc.), or possibly linking to increase in minimum wage or campaign finance reform. Both of these approaches will also generate uncertainty (but because a shift in the tax system will be perceived as less likely, the adverse impact on the economy would be less severe)."
D1			    • (c) Develop an alternative proposal for rerum-free filing or other major simplification of the present tax system (apparently House Democrats are exploring such options). A return-free systems raise many administrative problems (such as how to handle two­ earner couples, how to provide EITC, etc.) and either places additional burden on IRS when it is facing other problems (reorganization, year 2000 problem, etc.) or places additional burden on employers, or both.
D1			    2. Our strategy for enactment of our initiatives:
D1			    • (a) Micro strategy:  move individual  bills, possibly on one of pending  revenue measures in Senate (Coverdell, technical corrections, line-item veto substitutes, or, less probably, IRS restrucruri.ng). This approach requires Administration acceptance of the (possibly modified) Congressional bill (which is most troublesome in the case of the Coverdell bill. which provides tax credits for sending children to private schools) and offers the opportunity for a major Congressional tax bill.
D1			(b) Budget reconciliaton. (Alan Cohen will supply material)
D1			    3. Congressional initiatives:
D1			    • (a) Marriage penalties. This is a sympathetic issue, but is costly ($29 billion is one measure of penalties) and administratively complex to completely solve, though less costly targeted options providing limited relief can be designed.
D1			"Tax incentives for ""stay-home moms"". This issue has been raised in response to the Administration's proposal to expand the child and dependent tax credit. This will bias the tax system even more strongly against working mothers (who need the credit to offset actual out-of-pocket expenses), while defining ""stay-at-home moms"" in an administratively acceptable manner will be very difficult."
D1			    • (b) Estate tax repeal. TRA 97 provided significant immediate relief to owners of businesses, but provided a lengthy schedule (through 2006) for an increase in the estate tax deduction from $600,000 to $1 million, which might be accelerated if necessary to retain the estate tax (which is needed as backstop to income ta.x);
D1			    • (c) Flat Tax or National Sales Tax. These proposals have strong advocates (who greatly overstate resulting benefits of simplicity and economic growth), but as proposed have many problems, including failure to provide adequate revenue and failure to provide adequate transition relief while significantly shifting burden of tax from high-income taxpayers to others.
D1			    • (d) Cap tax revenues as a fixed percent of GDP. This proposal may have superficial appeal, but could set the stage for runaway deficits and an increase in Federal mandates on States and local governments in lieu of Federal programs. It might best be fought by getting out the correct facts (average tax rates on most families have gone down, actual tax/GDP ratio is much lower than suggested, etc.).
D1			"    • (e) Coverdell. This proposal, which provides tax credits to parents for the cost of their children's private elementary and secondary education, could erode support for high quality public education and will disproportionately favor higher-income families, who are far more able to afford private schooling for their children (even with the tax credit). To somewhat mask the unfairness, the proposal would also cover ""supplemental educational expenses"", which are ill-defined, will thus generate administrative difficulties, and will do little to reduce the bias in favor of higher-income families."
D1			    • (f) IRS restructuring. The House bill meets most of our concerns, and is preferable to earlier (Kerrey-Portrnan) versions and to Roth's likely proposals. The only negatives in the House bill concern inadequate personnel flexibilities and burden of proof and accountant-client privilege issues.
D1			    • (g) Deduction for payroll taxes. This proposal is very expensive (about $65 billion annually), and would disproportionately benefit high-income ta.xpayers (both because they have adequate ta.xable income against which the deduction may be offset, and because of the higher-ta.x rate to which the income being shielded would otherwise have been subject).
D1			Process for Enacting the President's Targeted Tax Cuts This Year
D1			The process for enacting one or many of the President's targeted tax cuts this year comes down to a question of what the possible tax vehicles are this year. There are a number of possibilities:
D1			    1. Reconciliation. The Budget Resolution could call for a reconciliation bill. Reconciling any paid-for tax cuts is dangerous because the reconciliation bill could also be used as a vehicle for tax cuts that use up some or all of the surpluses -- although if tax cuts that are not paid for are included, they should subject this year's Budget Resolution to a 60-vote point-of-order in the Senate. Nonetheless, to protect against reconciliation becoming a vehicle for big tax cuts, we should consider opposing having any reconciliation bill at all this year.
D1			    2. Tax bills that are already in the Senate. There are several tax bills that have already come over to the Senate from the House. This is important because, of course, a new tax bill cannot originate in the Senate. The bills that have already come over include  technical corrections, the Coverdell bill, and one or two bills that undo the line-item veto of certain tax provisions in the last tax bill. These bills could be amended in the Finance Committee or on the floor to include some or all of the President's targeted tax cuts, and then be sent back to the House for conference. Keep in mind that such a tax bill would  not have the protections ofreconciliation on the floor e.g. non-germane amendments can be added. This could be helpful in adding provisions we like, but it could be harmful if provisions we don't like are added or if the bill gets bogged down with a lot of controversial amendments.
D1			    3. New tax bills originating in the House. Chairman Archer may try to move a bill with provisions that reduce revenues as a percentage of GDP. Most likely, these would be mostly provisions which we don't like. Once again, if this bill got to the Senate floor, it would not have the protections ofreconciliation. Democrats could bottle it up there.
D1			There are two bills that Chairman Archer may consider must-pass this year, however. One is an extenders bill. This would be a good bill to which to try to attach the President's tax cuts.
D1			Second, if there is a tobacco settlement bill, it will have some tax components -- aside from the payments required of the tobacco companies. For example, the tax treatment of such payments would have clarified in legislation.· Thus a tobacco settlement bill could include a tax section to which other tax-related  provisions could  be attached.  The tobacco settlement bill-- IF IT MOVES, AND THAT IS A BIG IF --could be an ideal vehicle for targeted tax _cuts because we are already advocating using the tobacco settlement to pay for a number of popular spending  initiatives. Thus the bill could  develop an omnibus character with something for everyone.

D0			President Clinton's Child Tax Credit A Fact Sheet July JO, 1997
D0			The President's child tax credit includes the following features:
D0			Age:     • Covers children under 17 through 2002.     • After 2002, covers children under 19.
D0			Amount per-child:     • $400 in 1998     • $500 in 1999 and then indexed for inflation.
D0			Income Limits:     • Phased out for families with incomes between $60,000 and $75,000 until 2000.     • After 2000, the phase-out range is raised to between $80,000 and $100,000 and then indexed for inflation.
D0			Refundability to Cover Out-of-Pocket Income and Payroll Taxes:     • Working families who pay out of pocket federal taxes would benefit from the child tax credit. The child tax credit is calculated before the EITC and will be partially refundable. A family will get a child credit for their income taxes plus the extent to which their out­ of-pocket (employee share) payroll taxes exceed their EITC.
D0			Savings Incentive Feature:     • Taxpayers who are entitled to a child credit would have the opportunity to contribute their child tax credit plus an additional $500 per-child each year to a Kidsave Account for the child's education, first time home purchase, or the taxpayer's retirement. Earnings would accumulate tax-free in the account and no taxes would be due upon withdrawal for these purposes.
D0			Cost:     • $70.2 billion over 1997-2002.     • $176.l billion over 1997-2007.     • $22.0 billion in 2007.
D0			Working Families Who Pay Taxes and Play by the Rules Deserve a Tax Cut Too
D0			Compared to the President's proposal, the Senate bill denies the child credit to 3.8 million families who make Jess than $30,000. The House bill denies the child tax credit to 4.8 million of these families. The President strongly believes families who work hard, pay taxes, and play by the rules deserve a tax cut too.
D0			Examples of working families who receive a tax cut under President Clinton's plan but are shortchanged by Congressional plans:
D0			Example #1: A Family Like Police Officer Daniel Mercado's Consider a family like Police Officer Daniel Mercado's of Savannah, Georgia. A family like his with two parents, four children, and an income of$26,000 would receive a $1,238 child tax credit under President Clinton's proposal, but would not receive a child tax credit under the House or Senate bills.
D0			Federal Tax Situation Before Any Child Tax Credit/I: Income taxes owed before EITC Payroll taxes Gust employee share) Excise taxes/2 Federal out-of-pocket taxes owed before EITC Employer share of payroll taxes Federal taxes before EITC Benefit from EITC $285 $1,989 $400 $2,674 $1,989 $4,663 $1,036
D0			President Clinton's Proposal House Bill Senate Bill Child Tax Credit for family with two parents and four kids and income of $26,000 $1,238 $0 $0
D0			Notes: I:  Source: U.S. Department of Treasury. Assumes 1999 tax parameters. 2:      Estimate calculated from Congressional Budget Office Data. CBO estimates that in 1998, families with incomes between $20,000 and $30,000 would pay 1.54 percent of their income in federal excise taxes.
D0			Example #2: A Family Like Michelle Orticke's
D0			Consider afamily like Michelle Orticke 's, a receptionist from Springfield, Virginia. A family like hers with a mother and two children and an income o/$24,000 would receive a $1,000 child tax credit under President's Clinton's proposal. A family like this one would receive a smaller $651 child tax credit under the Senate bill and would receive no child tax credit under the House bill.
D0			Federal Tax Situation Before Any Child Tax Credit/I: Income taxes owed before EITC Payroll taxes (just employee share) Excise taxes/2 $1,380 $1,836 $370 Federal out-of-pocket taxes owed before EITC Employer share of payroll taxes Federal taxes before EITC Benefit from EITC $3,586 $1,836 $5,422 $1,457
D0			President Clinton's Proposal House Bill Senate Bill Child Tax Credit for family with one parent and two kids and income of $24,000 $1,000 $0 $651
D0			Notes: I:  Source: U.S. Department of Treasury. Assumes 1999 tax parameters. 2:      Estimate calculated from Congressional Budget Office Data. CBO estimates that in 1998, families with incomes between $20,000 and $30,000 would pay 1.54 percent of their income in federal excise taxes.

D0			Methodology of State-by-State Analysis
D0			Using the Treasury individual income tax model, an estimate was generated for the aggregate numbers of taxpayers in I 998 with Adjusted Gross Income below $30,000 who receive the child tax credit under President Clinton's proposal but not under the House and Senate bills. These aggregates were distributed across states in proportion to the fraction of EITC recipients nationwide in 1995 with incomes between $15,000 and $30,000 who reside in the particular state. EITC recipients with incomes between $I 5,000 and $30,000 form the group primarily affected by the differences in the child tax credit proposals. •

D0			President Clinton's Higher Education Tax Cut Proposal A Fact Sheet
D0			    • HOPE Scholarship. A maximum $1,500 credit for the first two years of postsecondary education. Students attending on at least a half-time basis would receive a 100% credit for the first $1,000 of tuition and required fees and a 50% credit for up to the next $1,000. For example, a student attending a community college with tuition costs of $1,400 would receive a $1,200 HOPE Scholarship. Scholarships would be phased out for joint filers with income between $80,000 and $ I 00,000, and for single filers with income between $50,000 and $70,000. After 2002, the HOPE Scholarship increases to a I00% credit for the first $ I,500 and a 50% credit for the next $1,000 of tuition and required fees.
D0			    • 20% Tuition Tax Credit. Undergraduates beyond their first two years, graduate students, plus working people going to school part-time to improve or acquire job skills, would benefit from a 20% tax credit on the first $5,000 of tuition and required fees through the year 2000 and after 2000 a 20% tax credit on the first $10,000 of tuition and required fees. The credit would be phased out at the same income levels as HOPE.
D0			    • Education and Retirement Savings Accounts. Allows penalty-free IRA withdrawals for undergraduate, post-secondary vocational, and graduate education expenses. Additionally, taxpayers eligible for the child tax credit are given the opportunity to deposit their child tax credit plus an additional $500, in a Kidsave Account for the child's education, first-time home purchase or the taxpayer's retirement.   Earnings would accumulate tax-free in the Kidsave Account and no taxes would be due upon withdrawal for an approved purpose.
D0			    • Employer-Provided Education Benefits. Extends permanently Section 127 of the tax code, which allows . people to exclude $5,250 of employer-provided education benefits from their taxable income. Eligibility for graduate education benefits would be reinstated retroactively back to June 30, 1996, with both undergraduate and graduate education eligible in the future. Additionally, a I 0% employer credit for small business training is included. This credit would apply to payments made to third parties to cover expenses of education for employees under employer-provided education assistance programs. The credit would be available to employers with average annual gross receipts of $10 million or less for the prior three years.
D0			    • Student Loan Interest Deduction. Allows a deduction for up to $2,500 per year of interest on education loans for expenses of students enrolled at an institution of higher education. The deduction would be allowed for the first 60 months interest is due on a loan. The deduction would phase out for taxpayers making between $45,000 and $65,000 ($65,000 and $85,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly). This deduction would be available even if the taxpayer does not itemize deductions.
D0			    • Community Service Loan Forgiveness. In most circumstances, a loan that is forgiven is considered income and is therefore taxable. To encourage programs that offer loan forgiveness to borrowers who take lower­ paying, community-service jobs, loan amounts forgiven through programs run by nonprofit tax-exempt charitable or educational institutions, and loans forgiven under the Direct Loan Program's income­ contingent repayment program, would be excluded from income. Currently, the exclusion generally covers only certain forgiveness arrangements between students and government entities.
D0			    • · Repeal Cap on Tax Exempt Bond Issuance by Colleges and Universities. Repeals the $150 million bond cap that affects private higher education institutions and certain other charitable institutions. The repeal would apply to tax-exempt bonds issued by these institutions to finance new capital expenditures.

Source: Education Department estimates based on State-level enrollment and Pell Grant recipient data.
D0			Methodology of State-by-State Analysis
D0			Using a nationally-representative sample of postsecondary students and data on Pell Grant recipients, an estimate was derived for the proportion of the total national number of recipients of the tax benefit in 1998. Using that ratio, the number of recipients for each State was determined. Based on the Joint Tax Committee and Treasury revenue estimates of the three plans for 1999, a dollar amount for each State was derived using the same ratio as the State/national number of beneficiaries.
D0			President Clinton's Higher Education Tax Cuts: Greater Benefits for More Families
D0			While providing the greatest help in the first two years, the Administration's plan has always gone much farther, granting a substantial tax cut for virtually any investment in postsecondary education or training. Unlike the Congressional plans, the President's tax credits cover more types and ages of postsecondary students, including:         ◦ part-time students (less than half-time) seeking to improve or acquire job skills;         ◦ students beyond their first two years of undergraduate study;         ◦ graduate students.
D0			Although the Administration, House and Senate plans all provide modest assistance for students who borrow or families who have special education savings accounts, for many situations that families find themselves in, the House and Senate plans provide little or no help. Consider the following:
D0			Tuition Tax Credits Under Various Situations President House Plan Senate Plan Two kids in college: Married couple, $60,000 income, with two kids in college: one at a community college with $2,000 tuition and $200 books, the other a junior at a private college with $10,000 tuition. $2,500 ($3,500 after year 2000) $1,I 00 $1,500 Divorced parent, same income: Single parent with $50,000 income, one child going to an average community college full- time ($1,200 tuition and fees) $1,100 $0 $0 Returning to school less than half-time: Family with $30,000 income, one parent going to a public four-year college part-time to change careers ($2,000 tuition and fees) $400 $0 $0 Child is beyond.first two years: Family with $40,000 income, one child is junior at average private college ($12,000 tuition and fees) $1,000 ($2,000 after year 2000) $0 $0 Returning to school full-time to become a teacher: Homemaker, family income of $70,000, attending graduate teacher training program at public university after being out of college for 20 years ($3,500 tuition). $700 $0 $0 Graduate student: Single graduate student with$15,000 income and tuition of $15,000. $1,000 $0 $0

T0			Karen:
D1			Elena asked that I send you a note to let you know that we spoke to ONDCP, and that they said that General Mccaffrey is committed to doing a press availability on the !OM-Medical Marijuana study tomorrow. After two  years of  pointing to the study, he feels obligated to  go on the record when it is released -- and, despite our suggestion, is not willing to pull back. I have attached McCaffrey's proposed statement and the Q&A prepared by his staff. If you still have concerns about the press availability, you or John will probably need to connect w/him directly. As you know, he doesn't feel obliged to take guidance  from us on this or any other matter he views as his responsibility.

D1			Q & A's for the Director on the IOM Report Prepared by Dan Schecter, Kate Malliarakis, Carol Gibson March 15, 1999
D1			    1. Does this report validate the message sent by voters in California, Arizona, Alaska, Washington,. Oregon, Nevada?
D1			    • I've said before that using the ballot to decide what  should  become  medicine is like asking the voters  to  make  air  traffic  control  decisions. We have always said and we continue to affirm  that  science,  not  the  ballot  box, should determine the practice of medicine.
D1			    • The report says that it is impossible to  estimate the  clinical  value  of marijuana and cannabinoids based on anecdotal reports. (Page 1 .19 IOM Report) This report does not address the political process that makes marijuana  available to  medically needy individuals.    And, it doesn't address public policy questions  such as the  distribution of  marijuana. But, the sense of the report indicates that distribution  marijuana  through  places  like Cannabis Buyers clubs would be inconsistent  with sensible  scientific practices.
D1			    2. Will ONDCP's position on the medical use of marijuana change as a result of this report?
D1			    • Actually this report supports ONDCP's position, as it highlights the need for targeted research on the compounds in marijuana that may be helpful to those in medical need.
D1			    • Medical advancement means rigorous testing before a new  drug is released to the public. To recognize this reality is not to shut out  the  possibility  of merit in the cannabis plant but it is to reject exaggerated, at times magical, claims for marijuana.
D1			"    3. The very first recommendation of the IOM study is to conduct more research into the effects of cannabinoids.   Yet it is impossible  to get marijuana in order to conduct research. Will you use the influence of your position to see that access to marijuana is placed on the ""fast track"" so that legitimate researchers can conduct the research called for in the IOM study?"
D1			    • The Federal government has established a process for determining the safety and efficacy of drugs. It is a process that has been in place and has proven l[fomques!.wpd  Page 271 to  work. I will continue to work with NIDA and FDA and NIH to  ensure  that this process is efficient and still protects the American public.
D1			"    4. The study very emphatically states (Page ES.7) that there is ""no conclusive evidence that the drug effects of marijuana are causally linked to the subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs."" What does this say about the ""Gateway Theory"" that you have held?"
D1			"    • The study actually supports the fact that most drug users begin with  nicotine, move to alcohol, and then to marijuana. The new point brought out in this report is that the use of marijuana for medical purposes does not fall into the ""gateway theory."""
D1			    •  The significant point is that this study says that we need more research to determine just exactly where and how research on the compounds of marijuana should be conducted.
D1			    5. Now that the IOM has concluded that there are potential medical benefits to marijuana, will the Federal government continue to arrest and incarcerate sick people who use the drug for pain relief?
D1			"    • There is nothing in the IOM report that concludes that there are benefits to smoked marijuana. In fact, the IOM report states that ""smoked marijuana is unlikely to be a safe medication for any chronic medical  condition."" (Page 3.48)"
D1			    • This question goes to the crux of the problem. On one hand, we have people who want an excuse to smoke marijuana to get high, claiming that they have debilitating medical conditions. On the other hand, we have a small group of terminally ill people who believe (rightly or wrongly) that marijuana offers them some relief.
D1			    • Federal law enforcement policy will continue to be as it has been--focused on drug traffickers.
D1			    • What we really need is for pharmaceutical companies to develop alternative delivery systems for the compounds in marijuana.
D1			    6. Will you now concede that there is medicinal value to marijuana?
D1			    • The IOM report raises serious questions about the medicinal value of smoked /[iomquest.wpd  Page 37/ marijuana.
D1			    • We've always supported the use of synthetic THC--dronabinol--in treating certain illnesses. The issue is smoked marijuana.
D1			    • What we need are alternative delivery  systems  to  ensure that those  few people who can't take dronabinol  have an effective  means  of  deriving whatever benefits are available in THC without the harmful effects of smoke. @nt. oc Page 3JI

D0			WHITE HOUSE DRUG POLICY OFFICE ISSUES STATEMENT ON INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE'S REPORT ON MARIJUANA AND MEDICINE
D0			(202) 395-6618 (Washington, D.C.) - The White House Office of National Drug Policy (ONDCP) issued the following statement today following the release of the Institute of Medicine's report Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base:
D0			In January 1997, ONDCP asked the Institute of Medicine to conduct a review of the scientific evidence for assessing the potential health benefits and risks of marijuana and its constituent cannabinoids. ONDCP believed that an objective and independent evaluation of research regarding the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes was appropriate given the ongoing debate about cannabis and its health effects.
D0			The report released today by the Institute of Medicine represents the most thorough analysis to date of the relevant scientific literature. It summarizes recent advances in molecular and behavioral neuroscience, in particular newly elaborated systems of transmitters, receptors, and antagonists - all illuminating the physiological effects of cannabinoids. The Institute of Medicine has addressed all issues that ONDCP requested be examined, including: the science base and gaps in scientific knowledge regarding use of marijuana for medicinal purposes; scientific information about marijuana's mechanism of action; peer-reviewed literature on the uses of marijuana; and costs associated with various forms of the component chemical compounds in marijuana and other pharmacotherapies for special medical conditions. We thank the principal investigators, members of the advisory panel, biomedical and social scientists, patients, advocates, report reviewers, and all who supported the Institute of Medicine in developing this comprehensive report.
D0			The report contains six specific recommendations that address: Continued research into the physiological effects of cannabinoids. Clinical trials of cannabinoid drugs for symptom management. Evaluation of psychological effects of cannabinoids in clinical trials. Studies of individual health risks in smoking marijuana. Clinical trials of marijuana use under limited circumstances for medical purposes. Short-term use of smoked marijuana under strict conditions for patients with debilitating symptoms. These recommendations are supported by the following observations: Scientific data indicate the potential therapeutic value of cannabinoids for pain relief, control of nausea and vomiting, and appetite stimulation. This value would be enhanced by a rapid onset of drug effect.     • l[slmrt.do'ci;;;  :========================= Page 4-11
D0			The psychological effects of cannabinoids are probably important determinants of their potential therapeutic value. They can influence symptoms indirectly, which could create false impressions of the drug effect or be beneficial as a form of adjunctive therapy.
D0			Numerous studies suggest that marijuana smoke is an important risk factor in the development of respiratory diseases, but the data that could conclusively establish or refute this suspected link have not been collected.
D0			Because marijuana is a crude THC delivery system that also delivers harmful substances, smoked marijuana generally should not be recommended for medical use. Nonetheless, marijuana is widely used by certain patient groups, which raises both safety and efficacy issues.
D0			If there is any future for marijuana as medicine, it lies in its isolated components -- the cannabinoids and their synthetic derivatives. Isolated cannabinoids will provide more reliable effects than crude plant mixtures. Therefore, the purpose of clinical trials of smoked marijuana would not be to develop marijuana as a licensed drug, but such trials could be a first step towards the development of rapid-onset, nonsmoked cannabinoid delivery systems.
D0			"ONDCP appreciates the contributions made by the Institute of Medicine to the debate on the medical efficacy and safety of cannabinoids. We will carefully study the recommendations and conclusions contained in this report. We will continue to rely on the professional judgement of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Director of the National Institutes of Health, and the Surgeon General on all issues related to the medical value of marijuana and its constituent cannabinoids. We note the report's conclusion that ""the future of cannabinoid drugs lies not in smoked marijuana, but in chemically-defined drugs that act on the cannabinoid systems that are a natural component of human physiology."" We look forward to the considered responses from our nation's public health officials to the interim solutions recommended by the report. - 30 –"

D0			Q &  A Methadone  Expansion  Announcement ) (    ON\) C°P  l.,M ._,,._,J
D0			What is the scope of the heroin problem?
D0			"Although a relatively small percentage of America's illegal drug users use heroin, the debilitating addictive effects of the drug make it one of the major sources of drug-related health, crime, and social costs. ONDCP estimates a population of 810,000 chronic heroin users in the United States in 1995. While the number of new heroin initiates is still relatively low, it is apparent that the availability of high-purity heroin (which can be smoked or snorted as well as injected) has led to an increase in use -- probably because users see smoking and snorting as ""safer"" than shooting up."
D0			What are the impacts of heroin use?
D0			Heroin is a toxic substance: The danger of a fatal overdose is more immediate and likely for a heroin user than for users of other common drugs of abuse because of the route of ingestion and common miscalculations of dosage. The National Institute of Drug Abuse has declared that heroin is a powerfully addicting substance producing tolerance, physical dependence, and the clinical state of addiction (defined as compulsive, often truly uncontrollable drug craving, seeking, and use).
D0			Heroin use is associated with crime: The need to purchase large amounts of a costly drug inevitably leads to crime. For decades some cities have estimated that over half of all property crime is attributable to heroin use. Twenty percent of all people arrested in Manhattan in 1997 tested positive for opiates. In the same year, 22 percent of all arrestees in Chicago tested positive for opiates.
D0			Heroin use affects public health: There is a strong nexus between heroin use and many life­ threatening communicable diseases, including infections such as hepatitis B and C, HIV/AIDS, and endocarditis; as well as tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases (especially as they relate to pregnancy outcomes).
D0			Why is methadone treatment needed?
D0			Heroin addiction is difficult to overcome: The psycho-pharmacological effects of heroin are extremely strong. Heroin users are more likely to be addicted to the drug than users of other drugs. (An ONDCP study of cocaine, crack, and heroin abuse in six cities found that the percentage of heroin users who used heroin for 30 or more consecutive days over a 90 day period was four times greater than the percentage for crack and powder cocaine users).
D0			Kicking the heroin habit without methadone as a bridge to abstinence is difficult: the same study found that heroin users reporting 30 or more consecutive days of abstinence in a 90 day period tended to be lower than for crack or powder cocaine users.
D0			Why Methadone?
D0			"Methadone has been used for the treatment of heroin addiction since the 1960s. It is a synthetic agonist agent for opiates. In other words, methadone operates by ""occupying"" the brain receptor sites that are affected by heroin and blocks the craving attendant to addiction. Because withdrawal from methadone is slower than from heroin, it is relatively easy to maintain an addict on methadone without abrupt side effects."
D0			Methadone treatment is the most widely used treatment for heroin addiction today. It has been studied more than any other drug treatment modality, with uniformly positive results. Over 115,000 Americans are able to lead stable lives as a result of methadone treatment. Over 900 methadone treatment programs in America provide an invaluable service.
D0			Some people have criticized methadone. How effective is methadone?
D0			The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) has conducted literally dozens of studies which show the effectiveness of methadone treatment. The Drug Abuse Treatment Outcome Study (DATOS), the most recent study by NIDA, found that among participants in outpatient methadone treatment, weekly heroin use decreased 69 percent, cocaine use by 48 percent (many heroin users are polydrug users), illegal activity decreased 52 percent, and full time work increased by 24 percent.
D0			How much does methadone treatment cost?
D0			Methadone treatment, at an average cost of$13 or less per day, is a cost effective alternative to incarceration.
D0			Given methadone's effectiveness, why is this new initiative needed?
D0			In spite of this proven track record, methadone treatment capacity has not experienced marked growth. Treatment capacity is insufficient to provide most of the 810,000 heroin addicts with methadone treatment or any other effective form of drug abuse treatment. In 1995, the Institute of Medicine identified ten states in which methadone treatment was not available at all: Arkansas, Idaho, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Vermont, and West Virginia.
D0			Additionally, studies have shown that not all methadone treatment programs are equal; the full benefits of methadone treatment are only obtained within a comprehensive treatment environment, which screens and evaluates patients and assigns them to treatment regimes based upon the nature of each patient's addiction. However, a 1990 GAO report found that policies, goals and practices varied greatly and that not one of the programs studied evaluated the effectiveness of their treatment. The failures of the unsuccessful programs tarnished the entire idea of methadone treatment, rather than spurring efforts to improve the delivery of services. This initiative is designed to ensure uniform effectiveness through new standards for all programs.
D0			How will this initiative make methadone treatment more available, more effective, and better controlled?
D0			    • Expansion of Treatment Capacity: The President's National Drug Control Strategy calls for an expansion of drug treatment capacity across the board. Specifically the Strategy seeks to reduce the gap between need and capacity by 20 percent by 2002 and by 50 percent by 2007. For heroin addicts, this means that we must increase treatment capacity to reach all who are prepared to accept effective drug treatment and supervision.
D0			    • Development of a standardized accreditation system for methadone treatment programs with transfer of regulatory oversight for methadone from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA):
D0			Replace the current regulatory approach, which focuses exclusively on process standards, with a new system that is more reflective of on an outcome-oriented accreditation model. CSAT/SAMHSA will lead the interagency effort to evaluate the accreditation process and proposed accreditation standards beginning in 1999. Based on the results of the evaluation, feedback from treatment experts, and public comments on the NPRM, a final rule will be promulgated that will introduce modernized treatment standards and an accreditation process. In the interim, programs will remain subject to FDA oversight and monitoring. Law enforcement (anti-diversion) responsibilities will remain with DEA.
D0			    • Elimination of regulatory barriers to allow individual physician administration of methadone: As physician training in the administration of opioid agonist treatment is accomplished, we must change the ineffective regulations which hinder effective treatment and allow trained physicians flexibility in how to administer this treatment (for example, through office visits as opposed to clinical programs). New regulations expanding access to methadone will be issued when testing has validated their effectiveness.
D1			How will this effort be paid for?
D1			The President's drug treatment budget request exceeds $3 billion, an increase of$206.5 million over FY 1998. Funding for this initiative will come from the treatment component of the President's counter-drug budget.
D1			What is the timetable for this initiative?

E0			CAMPAIGN    PovToBACCo-fREE icAs
E0			August 7, 1998
E0			General Barry R. Mccaffrey Director Office of National Drug Control Policy 750- 17th Street, NW Washington, DC 20006
E0			Dear General McCaffrey:
E0			As we have stated previously, we are enthused and heartened by your National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign. Your careful planning, support from Congress, the media, the business community and many others are strong indications that this campaign will be a success in curbing illegal drug use among our nation's children. In addition , we hope it will be a precedent and a model for a national counter-marketing program against youth tobacco use.
E0			However, there is one aspect of your Campaign that concerns us greatly. We understand that the Bates USA advertising agency is handling the media planning and buying for Phase II of the program and is in contention to be awarded Phase Ill - the full roll out of the entire Campaign activities.
E0			"This is most unfortunate. Bates 'USA is an advertising agency that is a key partner of the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, and handles: Capri, a cigarette marketed to women; Kool, a menthol cigarette backed by a new campaign with seductive imagery - ""B Kool"" - aimed at attracting a younger audience; and Lucky Strike, which is featured in a cover story in this week's Advertising Age (see attached) in which a Bates executive discusses ""marketing strategies to reach the target audience of young adults through underground and lifestyle channels."""
E0			"As you will note in the attached article from the New York Times, Bates has strengthened its position in the Brown & Williamson roster of advertising agencies and ""handles so-called premium brands and Grey the so-called value brands."""
E0			Awarding Bates your valued contract would send a very negative message:
E0			"    • It would be a conflict of interest , in that Bates could not be expected to do its best in media negotiations and buys in which the ""matching"" time and space they acquire could be used for anti-tobacco messages,  thus working against their Brown & Williamson client. Indeed , it is possible that Brown and Williamson would not allow Bates to engage in media strategies that are truly effective. The tobacco industry has a history of threatening and punish ing vendors, including advertising agencies, that engage in activities to which the industry objects."

E0			General Barry Mccaffrey August 7, 1998 Page 2
E0			    • It would raise questions about the credibility of the program. For years the tobacco industry has claimed that they don't market to kids.  On a number of occasions  they have promoted campaigns that they claimed were designed to discourage tobacco use among children. However, independent experts who have studied these campaigns have always concluded that the campaigns were ineffective and were public relations ploys designed to get Congress off the tobacco industry's back, and not to reduce tobacco use.
E0			    • It would say to Madison Avenue and the business community at large that it is perfectly fine -in fact it is rewarding - to handle tobacco marketing and advertising, which has been shown to attract children to begin smoking as well as the selection of the brands they smoke, and at the same time be given important government anti-drug business. This is most assuredly not the message that should be sent.
E0			    • It would be extremely discouraging to the public health and_tobacco control community, which is fighting against the tobacco industry and its billions of dollars in marketing, legal, lobbying, political contributions and special interest politics.
E0			And finally, General Mccaffrey, awarding Bates your business would be a potential embarrassment to the Clinton Administration and those many members  of Congress who have taken a very strong position against tobacco marketing to children and in favor of comprehensive tobacco control legislation, including curbs on marketing practices that influence children to smoke and use spit tobacco.
E0			The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and its many partners are watching your National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign with great interest and hope. Please do not disappoint us by bringing into your team an ad agency that is working effectively for Big Tobacco, and as such represents a threat to America's children.
E0			We would be pleased to discuss this with you or members of your staff. We look forward to a continuing partnership in reducing drug use in America, including tobacco, which is illegal for children.

T0			July 8, 1998 DRUG MEDIA CAMPAIGN LAUNCH
T0			DATE:   July 9, 1998 LOCATION:   Sidney J. Marcus Auditorium World Congress Center MEET & GREET: 9:45 am - I 0:00 am EVENT TIME: 10: 15 am - 11 :25 am FROM:   Bruce Reed
D1			    I. PURPOSE
D1			To launch the largest ever national media campaign to target youth drug use and educate young people and their parents on the dangers of drugs.
D1			    II. BACKGROUND
D1			At this event, you will launch the national expansion of the historic youth anti-drug media campaign -- which is already underway in 12 pilot cities. This is the largest publicly funded anti-drug campaign, with a total proposed budget of $1 billion over five years and a dollar-for-dollar match from each media outlet airing the ads. Using the full power of the mass media to change youth attitudes toward drugs, the campaign will ensure that when teens and adults turn on the television, listen to the radio, or surf the Internet, they will get the message that drugs are dangerous, wrong, and can kill you. Children are exposed to many media messages that normalize drugs.  The campaign will utilize modem media and technology to give alternative messages that will compete with these influences.
D1			By changing attitudes, youth drug use can be reduced. Studies of drug use rates over the last thirty years show that when young people disapprove of drugs and consider them dangerous, youth use rates decline. Furthermore, we now know that if a child can reach the age of 21 without using drugs, he or she will probably never use them.
D1			Specifically, you will announce the following:
D1			"        ◦ A television ""roadblock"" that will air Thursday evening -- where every network will show the same counter-drug ad at 9:00 PM (EST). This ad will reach an estimated 85 percent of American television viewers. The roadblock will be supplemented by print ads in the nation's top 100 newspapers and radio ads in the top 100 media markets."
D1			        ◦ Local media buys to target specific drug problems in certain regions of the country. All new ads will provide the campaign clearinghouse number (800-288- 7800) that will be staffed 24 hours a day and provide information on drug prevention. The campaign's new interactive website for parents and youth (www.projectknow.com.) will also be unveiled at the event.
D1			        ◦   The anti-drug media campaign is more than just ads. It is coupled with public­ '!,rivate partnerships that will generate a wide range of coordinated anti-drug activities with schools, civic organizations, community anti-drug coalitions, and others. It also challenges media outlets to match the campaign's efforts -- on a dollar for dollar basis -- with related pro-bona ads or programming time for youth drug prevention.
D1			You will be addressing audience of 600: including; 300 students ages 11-15 throughout Georgia; parents; local anti-drug advocates; community activists; and Members of Congress. In addition, the event will be carried live to over 150 satellite event sites around the country.
D1			    III. PARTICIPANTS Event Participants: General McCaffrey Speaker Newt Gingrich Senator Max Cleland Governor Zell Miller Mayor Bill Campbell James Miller, 17 yeai;-old from Portland, Oregon. James co-chairs the Regional Drug Initiative and speaks to kids about staying drug free. He is committed to not using drugs because of the pain caused by his mother's addiction when he was young. Kim Willis, 8th grader from Erie, Pennsylvania. She is very active in her school's anti­ drug coalition Kids Interacting Drug-Free Coalition (KIDco). She serves as the KIDco leader for her class and represents her Region in the Statewide organization.

D1			Taking the President's Anti-Drug Media Campaign Nationwide July 9, 1998
D1			Today in Atlanta, the President launches the national expansion of the Anti-Drug Media Campaign he first proposed in last year's drug strategy and budget. The kick-off of the 5-year, $2 billion Anti-Drug Media Campaign will be linked by satellite to over 150 sites around the country.
D1			The Largest Targeted Effort Ever to Teach Youth About Drugs The President's Anti-Drug Media Campaign is designed to use the full power of the mass media to change youth attitudes toward drugs. It is designed to let teens know -- when they turn on the television, listen to the radio, or surf the 'Net -- that drugs are dangerous, wrong and can kill you. Activities planned for today's nationwide launch include:
D1			"            ▪ A television ""roadblock"" that will air this evening -- where every network will show the same counter-drug ad at 9:00p.m. (EST). This ad will reach an estimated 85 percent of American television viewers. The roadblock will be supplemented by print ads in the nation's top I 00 newspapers and radio ads in the top 100 media markets."
D1			            ▪ Local media buys to target specific drug problems in certain regions of the country. All new ads will provide the campaign clearinghouse number (800-288-7800) that will be staffed 24 hours a day and provide information on drug prevention. The campaign's new interactive website for parents and youth (www.projectknow.com.) will also be unveiled.
D1			            ▪ In January I 998, the campaign began in 12 pilot cities (Atlanta, Baltimore, Boise, Denver, Hartford, Houston, Milwaukee, Portland (OR), San Diego, Sioux City, Tucson, and Washington, D.C.). Since ads started to run in these pilot cities, anti-drug awareness has increased and requests for anti-drug publications increased by more than 300 percent.
D1			More Than an Ad Campaign             ▪ The anti-drug media campaign is more than just ads. It is coupled with public-private partnerships that will generate a wide range of coordinated anti-drug activities with schools, civic organizations, community anti-drug coalitions, and others. It also challenges media outlets to match the campaign's efforts -- on a dollar for dollar basis -­ with related pro-bono ads or programming time for youth drug prevention.
D1			A Record of Accomplishment             ▪ The President has consistently proposed the largest, most ambitious anti-drug budgets ever -- and more than $17 billion for FY 99. His 1998 National Drug Control Strategy is a comprehensive ten-year plan designed to cut drug use and its availability in half. Among other initiatives, the Strategy continues the anti-drug media campaign, funds improves and expands the Safe and Drug-Free Schools program, shields our borders with 1,000 new Border Patrol officers and advanced drug detection technologies, strengthens law enforcement with new DEA agents to crack down on heroin and methamphetamine traffickers, and cuts crime by testing and treating crime-committing addicts.
D0			PRESIDENT CLINTON: REDUCING TEENAGE DRUG USE
T0			July 9, 1998
D0			"""Parents, the media, athletes, the government -- all of us must fa/fill our obligation to protect our children from drugs. But nothing we do will make a bit of difference unless young people also take responsibility for themselves.   No one is too young to understand that drugs are wrong. No one is too immature to take responsibility and say no to drugs. We will do everything we can to help you -- but in the end, it is up to you. You can use drugs and risk your life, or you can reject drugs and reach for your dreams. As the ad we saw today said: 'Any Questions?'"""
T0			President Bill Clinton July 9, 1998
D1			THE LARGEST TARGETED EFFORT EVER To TEACH YOUTH ABOUT DRUGS. The President's Anti-Drug Media Campaign is designed to use the full power of the mass media to change youth attitudes toward drugs. This Campaign is designed to let teens know -- when they tum on the television, listen to the radio, or access the Internet -- that drugs are dangerous, wrong, and can kill you. Today's announcement will be reinforced by:
D1			"    • A television ""roadblock"" that will air this evening -- where every network will show the same anti-drug advertisement this evening during the 9:00 p.m. (EDT) viewing hour. This advertisement will reach an estimated 85 million viewers. The roadblock advertisement will be supplemented by print ads in the nation's top 100 newspapers and radio ads in the top I 00 media markets"
D1			    • Local media buys to target svecific drug vroblems in certain regions of the country. All new advertisements will provide the Campaign's clearinghouse number (1-800-288-7800), which will be staffed 24 hours a day and provide information on drug prevention. The campaign's new interactive web site (www.projectknow.com) will also be unveiled.
D1			    • Existing vrograms that started in 12 cities earlier this year. In January 1998, the Campaign began in 12 pilot cities. These cities have seen an increase in anti-drug awareness and a 300 percent increase in requests for anti-drug publications.
D1			A PARTNERSITTP WITH THEPRIVATE SECTOR. The Campaign is more than just a series of advertisements. It is coupled with a public-private partnership that will generate a wide range of coordinated anti-drug activities with schools, civic organizations, community anti-drug coalitions and others. The Campaign is also challenging media outlets to match, on a dollar for dollar basis, the efforts put forth by the Campaign with time for youth drug prevention programming or related pro-bono ads.
D1			BUILDING ON A RECORD OF ACCOMPLISHMENT. The President has made drug interdiction and prevention a top priority during his term in office, including:
D1			    • The Largest Anti-Drug Budgets Ever. The President has consistently proposed the largest anti-drug budgets ever. Between 1996 and 1998, resources for drug control increased by 19%, and the President's budget for fiscal year 1999 calls for an increase in funding for drug control, youth drug prevention efforts, domestic law enforcement, and interdiction.
D1			    • Developing a Comprehensive National Drug Control Strategy. The President has announced a comprehensive ten-year plan to reduce drug use and its consequences in the United States by 50%. This strategy will help reduce illegal drug use through law enforcement, prevention, treatment, interdiction and international cooperation.
D1			    • Strengthening and Expanding the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act. President Clinton expanded the Drug-Free Schools Act into the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Act of 1994, making violence prevention a key part of this program. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program provides support for violence and drug prevention programs to 97% of the nation's school districts. Schools  use  these  funds  to  keep  violence,  drugs  and alcohol away from students and out of schools. '   V.  !\l f)  •   .   •    - '

T0			REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT IN LAUNCHING THE NATIONAL YOUTH ANTI-DRUG MEDIA CAMPAIGN
T0			Sidney Marcus Auditorium Georgia World Congress Center
T0			Atlanta, Georgia
T0			10:40 A.M. EDT
D0			THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you very much. (Applause.) First  of  all, let's begin by  giving Kim and James  another  hand. Didn't they do a good job?  (Applause.)   They spoke well for you.  ·
D0			Mr. Speaker, Governor Miller, Mr. Mayor, General McCaffrey, General Reno, Secretary Shalala, I thank you all for your superb efforts in this endeavor. I'd like to say a special word of appreciation to Jim Burke, the President of the Partnership for a Drug Free America. He's not as well-known to most American children as the President or the Speaker or the Governor, but no American has done more to save the children of this country from the horror of drug abuse than Jim Burke. And we all owe him a very great debt of gratitude. Thank you. (Applause.)
D0			I'd also like to thank the Ad Council, the Community Anti-Drug Coalition, the athletic teams and sports figures that are represented here today, the business groups, the Georgia Attorney General, and Agriculture Commissioner of the other state and municipal and county officials -- and Congress Peter Deutch • from Florida is here with us today. I thank all of them for being here. And there are many others who aren't here who are supporting what we are doing together as Americans.
D0			   I was interested when we just watched the ads  to  see what  the young people's reaction was to the various ads. I was wondering to myself whether the ads that were most effective with me were also the ones that were most effective to you, or whether they were  different. I say that  to  make the point that the
D0			Speaker made so eloquently -- in the end this is about you, what touches you, what you believe, what your convictions are.
D0			We know from the stories that we just heard from James and from Kim, we know from all the available scientific research, that what Governor Miller said is right -- attitudes drive actions. There are lots of other factors. There are some places where kids are subject to more temptation than others; there are some blocks where there are more drug dealers than others;  all of  us have to  deal  with  that.   But we know that the more young people fear drugs, the more they disapprove of them, the less likely they are to use them. Therefore, kicking America's drug habit requires a dramatic change in attitudes, accompanied and reenforced by a dramatic increase in personal responsibility by all Americans.
D0			Parents have the greatest power -- that's what one of the ads showed us. The ads we saw today are not meant to replace parents' voices, but to  reenforce them. Ultimately,  the best drug enforcement program, the best drug prevention program is an effective, caring, loving parent sitting down with a child and talking seriously about drugs early.
D0			Parents have already told us that these ads help to break the ice with their children. So I ask the  parents of America today, don't wait until your children are using drugs to talk to them about drugs. Watch the ads together and discuss them, beginning tonight.
D0			Every one of the rest of us can, and must, help parents to teach their children to turn away from drugs. The entertainment industry can shape attitudes, as anyone who has a teenager can tell you. The media should never glamorize drugs. I'm pleased that across the  entertainment  industry,  a real effort is now being made to help, with the anti-drug messages on the Wonderful World of Disney, anti-drug chat groups on America Online, even training sessions about youth drug use for screenwriters and producers at Fox -- something I hope we will see for all people who prepare television programs on all networks.
D0			Professional athletes can shape attitudes. I thank Major League Soccer, the Florida Marlins, the New York Mets, Atlanta's own Braves for agreeing to air the ads during their home games. And while one of government's primary responsibilities is to enforce the law -- and we should -- we can also support this change in attitudes.
D0			As General  McCaffrey  said,  with  the help  of  the Speaker and people from across the political spectrum, we have aggressively pursued a comprehensive anti-drug strategy. We've put more police on our streets. We've strengthened our border patrols. We've toughened penalties. We do more drug testing of prisoners and parolees to break the link between crime and drugs. We work more with countries where drugs are grown and processed to try to stop the drugs from coming into the United States in the first place.
D0			But with this ad campaign, in which the public's investment is matched dollar for dollar by private partners, America is mounting a new and sweeping effort to change the attitude of an entire generation of young people.
D0			Already, we've seen an impact in the 12 cities where the ads have run as a pilot project. Calls -- listen to this --in just those 12 cities, calls to local anti-drug coalition hotlines have increased by up to 500 percent. Calls to our national anti-drug helpline have nearly tripled. Young people here in Atlanta say that the ads make them realize the serious consequences of using drugs. In Denver, middle school students think the ads could scare kids out  of  using drugs, to quote one of them. In Washington, D.C., young people say, to quote one, the ads make them stop and think about what illegal drugs can do.
D0			Tonight, when these ads run on every national television network, they will reach more than 40 million Americans, including millions and millions of children. That is  just the beginning. Over the next five years, we'll help to make sure that when young people turn on the television, listen to the radio, read the newspaper, or surf the Web, they get the powerful message that drugs are wrong, illegal, and can kill.
D0			I'm proud to say, as has already been said by General McCaffrey, that this national media campaign was a part of the historical bipartisan balanced budget agreement reached last year with Speaker Gingrich and the other leaders of Congress. And I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for including this in our budget agreement. It shows what we can accomplish when we put progress ahead of partisanship. I will work with the Congress to fund other important programs in our drug control strategy.
D0			All of us -- parents, the media, athletes, business, government -- have an opportunity and an obligation to make a real difference in the  fight  against  drugs.  But nothing  we do will succeed, as the Speaker said, unless young people also take responsibility for themselves.
D0			We've heard some personal stories; I'd like to close with two -- one from my family, and one from the job the American people have so generously given me these six years. Let me begin with the job.
D0			I spent a lot of time haranguing, cajoling, trying to persuade, sometimes putting brutal pressure on countries where drugs are grown or processed, or through which drugs pass, trying to get people to stop doing things that send drugs  to us.  And we've had some success. We supported remarkable efforts by the Coast Guard, for example, to cut off drugs before they get to this country. But  we can never  cut  off  the  whole  flow.  And every time I'd do this, some leader of a country where drugs are grown will say: You know, Mr. President, you're right,  we have a lot of poor farmers in our country, and I wish they'd grow something else. But America has four percent of the  world's people and you're buying almost 50 percent of the world's drugs. Nobody is making you buy those drugs. So you can say whatever you want to us.  If  you just  said tomorrow  -- everybody  in America said, we're not going to buy any more drugs, all our farmers would immediately start to grow something legal and good. And that's true. (Applause.)
D0			Now, that doesn't let them off the hook, it  doesn't excuse the inexcusable behavior of the Colombian drug cartels or any other groups in any part of the world. But it is true. It is true. It doesn't mean we should stop trying to kill the drugs at the border and stop the imports and break the drug gangs. But it's true. If  every  American young person tomorrow  said, no, thank  you, they  would grow something else.   The laboratories would make other chemicals that are legal and not harmful. (Applause.)
D0			I'll tell you another story that's fairly well-known, but I want you to think about what it means for families. This young man was brave enough to say that his mother used drugs, and talk about what -- the pain it caused the family. My brother  nearly  died from a cocaine habit. And I've asked myself a thousand times, what kind of fool  was I that  I did not know this  was going on.   You know, I got myself  elected President, I'm supposed to know what people are thinking, what's going on in their minds. How did this happen that I didn't see this coming and didn't stop it?
D0			And when it all happened he said -- I said, when did this start? He said,  well, in high school; I started using marijuana and drinking beer. I said, how often? He said, every day. And I thought to myself, what kind of family member was I? And these things make you do really bad things. They make you abuse other people. Most of the people selling drugs on the street are out there  supporting  their  own  habits. So you take other people, people who are basically good people, and you turn them into animals, because they don't care what they do to anybody else because they've got to get the money if they have to destroy somebody else, so they can keep feeding their own habits. They destroy  families.  Mothers  who love their  sons wind up neglecting them, abusing them, walking away, weakening the family. Everybody gets hurt. Nobody in America is free of this. Not the President. Not any community, any school, any church, any neighborhood.
D0			So the hardest thing in the  world  to  do is to  get people to change their habits, especially if what you're doing feels  good in the  moment. But it's very important.   Nothing is so important -- not the laws, not the investments, not anything. Nothing is so important as what the American people get up and do every day, just because they think it's theright thing to do. Nothing comes close to it.
D0			So we're here today because we took a little bit of the money the American people gave the national government -- a billion dollars over the next five years -- put it with at least that much and maybe more coming from private sources, to send a message to all these kids. I look at all these little girls out here in their Girl Scouts or their Brownie uniforms -- the message seems simple today. When they're 14 or 15 or 16 or 17 or 18, and life  gets more  complicated,  it's real important  that  they carry  with them the message that they have today deep in their  heart.
D0			I look at all these kids with these America's Pride tee-shirts on, and what I want them to do is to go back and somehow reach all those kids that are in their schools that don't wear those tee-shirts. There's somebody like my brother back at your school who is a good kid, just a little lost.  Somebody  told him something is all right that wasn't. And the family members were just  a little out of it  and  couldn't  believe it  was going on. You can save them. That's what these ads are all about.
D0			These ads are designed to knock America  upside  the head and get America's attention, and to empower all of  you  who  are trying to do the right thing. (Applause.) Please do it.
D0			Thank you and God bless you. (Applause.)

D1			The drug PSAs are ready to be unveiled and we could have the President announce them in  the Radio  Address -- and distribute  them  to  all the  news organizations  to  get  some free media. The first one will air in DC/Balitmore media market on Jan. 51 so we should try to find a time for the President to launch them before or on the 5th. After that, Members of Congress  will be holding their own  press conferences  in their districts to roll them out.   If  we want  to  announce  them this weekend, we still need to check with Media and Leg. Affairs, so we should decide quickly. If we don't do it this weekend, does everyone agree we should submit a scheduling for a Presidential event on or before the 5th? Let me know. Thanks.      - He   e! A--ir- THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON

T0			Dear President Clinton:
D1			We need your help. Our proposed $175 million youth-oriented, anti-drug media campaign is at risk. It has yet to gain broad congressional support from Republicans.
D1			We are now entering the short mark-up period during which the campaign's  fate will be decided.  Would sugge t that using a Saturday radio address to endorse the campaign would help sway those who are still unconvinced about its merits.
D1			There are many demands on your time. Few, however, offer such a potential pay-off. As you know, drug use has doubled among our youth, tripling among eighth graders in the past five years. We are confident this campaign can drive down drug use rates among eighth-graders by fifteen percent within three years. Your intervention will increase our chances of succeeding. . :· •·
T0			<.:..:: Very respectfully,
T0			The Honorable William Jefferson Clinton The White House
T0			EXECUflVE OFFICE OF THE PRFSIDENT OFFICE OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY Washington,  D.C. 20S03
D0			Potential Benefits of ONDCP's Youth-Oriented Anti-Drug Media Campaign
D1			PURPOSE. To suggest the potential benefits of the $175 million youth-oriented anti-drug campaign on a typical congressional district.
D1			ASSUMPTIONS.
D1			    1. Without inten'ention, usage of illegal drugs will continue to rise among America's 68 million children.
D1			    2. There are approximately 7,250 eighth-graders in a typical congressional district. This number will not change drastically in the next five years.
D1			        ◦ If the increase in current usage rates of the past five years among 8th-graders is unchecked, by 2001, 22.8% of eight-graders will be using illegal drugs. That means 1,653 8th-graders in a typical congressional district would be using illegal drugs.
D1			    3. This $175 million media campaign, in conjunction with other ongoing drug prevention efforts, will result in a fifteen percent reduction in drug usage rates among our youth.
D1			        ◦ The annual investment, per child, of this campaign is just $2.57.
D1			POTENTIAL BENEFITS.
D1			    1. If the media campaign is fully funded, 551 fewer 8th-g raderswill be using drugs in e;,ich congressional district in 2001.
D1			    2. This reduction in use translates into dramatic savings.
D1			        ◦ Columbia University's Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse estimates that children who smoke marijuana are eighty-five times more likely to use cocaine.
D1			        ◦ A recent study suggests that the saving a high-risk youth (i.e. a current illegal drug user) might prevent costs to society of between $1.5 - $2 million -- the estimated damage caused by a typical addict over a life-time of drug use.
D1			        ◦ If this Campaign deters just one 8th-grader in each congressional district from beginning the descent toward addiction, the campaign will have achieved a three-fold return on a modest investment.

E0			Excerpts from May 14, 1997 statement by General Barry McCaffrey, before the Senate Appropriations Committee, Subcommittee on Treasury, General Government and Civil Service
E0			Comments about the $175 Million Youth-Oriented Anti-Drug Campaign.
E0			        ◦ Drug use has gone up among America's  youth during the p_ast  five years.  The principal reasons that more of our children are using drugs is that fewer of them disapprove of illegal drug use and fewer perceive regular drug use as dangerous. The University of Michigan's Monito,:ing the Future Study makes clear this association between attitudes and usage rates.
E0			        ◦ Unfortunately, in recent years the number of drug-related public service announcements (PSAs) carried by television, radio and print media have decreased markedly. The economics of the media industr-y have made advertising space so competitive that pro-bono advertising has dropped more than 30 percent in recent years. Even worse, virtually no PSAs appear in prime-time.
E0			        ◦ We seek to reverse this trend by developing a public education campaign that supplements anti-drug announcements already offered by dedicated organizations like the Partnership for a Drug-Free America under Jim Burke's leadership and the Ad Council.
E0			        ◦ The President's FY 1998 budget seeks to fund this targeted educational campaign through the $175 million provided in ONDCP's Special Forfeiture Fund. ONDCP will also seek matching private sector donations. The campaign will use both paid and public service television announcements to inform youth and their parents of the consequences of drug use.
E0			"        ◦ Targeted TV ads are among the quickest, most efficient and effective means of reducing drug use. They can modify adolescent perception of drug harmfulness and increase societal disapproval of drugs. They can also reach ""baby boomer"" parents who may be ambivalent about sending strong antidrug messages to their children."
E0			        ◦ Attitudes can be changed with accurate and convincing messages. ONDCP believes this campaign can help to reduce youth drug use dramatically.
T0			EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OFFICE OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY Washington,  D. C.  20503
T0			ONDCP's National Anti-Drug Media Campaign
D1			    • The challenge: To reverse the current sharp rise in illegal drug use by young Americans.
D1			    • The Problem:
D1			        ◦ Drug use has been increasing among our youth over the past five years, tripling among eighth graders.
D1			        ◦ This upsurge in drug usage rates was preceded by changing attitudes towards drugs. Young Americans became more tolerant of illegal drug use and less worried about the consequences.
D1			        ◦ Anti-drug messages have declined markedly since 1989, even while messages normalizing illegal drug use have proliferated in popular music, TV, film, Internet, fashion, humor, and other forms of mass communications.
D1			    • The rationale for a funded anti-drug media campaign.
D1			        ◦ Targeted, mass media advertising works. It sells products and ideas from cereals to seat belt use.
D1			        ◦ Public Service Announcements (PSAs) by themselves are insufficient. They do not reach the right audiences with the required frequency because they air sporadically and in the wrong time spots.
D1			        ◦ Children spend mor time watching TV than in school.  Other media outlets (i.e._ radio, cinema, computer software, the Internet, newspapers, and magazines) are also vehicles to reach young Americans and their parents.  ·
D1			    • Why $175 million?
D1			        ◦ The cost of effectiveness -- reaching 90% of all 9 - 17 year olds at least four times a week.
D1			        ◦ In line with per capita costs(< $1) of publicly-funded CA & MA anti-smoking campaigns.
D1			"        ◦ Represents ""seed money."" Crucial component of the campaign is matching contributions from corporate partners."

D1			"For FY 98, McCaffrey has requested iet $175 million for a ""national media campaign targeting illegal drug consumption by youth. This initiative would rely on high-impact, anti-drug television advertisements aired during prime-time to educate and inform the public on the dangers of illegal drug use."""
D1			"This is the  totality  of information that McCaffrey  now  has on  this initiative. He has had several conversations with Jim Burke, with the Partnership for  Drug-Free  America  (the folks  who did ""this is your brain, this is your brain on drugs"") about getting industry to match every dollar that  we provide -- - $350 million for a national media campaign is not bad."
D1			McCaffrey's conversations w/ Burke are probably a reflection of something the POTUS said in a meeting. On December 12,  1996, the President  had his  Drug Council Meeting  -- which is effectively  a Cabinet  Meeting focused on drugs.   During the closed meeting, McCaffrey mentioned the ad campaign  and both POTUS and VPOTUS were extremely interested. POTUS  wanted to write a letter to the networks pointing out how few anti-drug PSAs there are on TV these days --  I think there is a 30% drop since 1990, andthen challenging them to match our funding for a media campaign.  Gore was  going to talk to Reed Hundt. I sent Rahm a memo about this back then.
D1			Mentioning the National Media Campaign for drug-free youth would be good SOTU material -­ which I assume is why you were asking -- especially if he was challenging the TV industry/media to match the contribution -- - shame them and then challenge them (I bet we could get a read from Jim Burke beforehand whether this would be a challenge that could be met before POTUS did it).

E0			Methamphetamine Trends in Five Western States and Hawaii
E0			Executive Office of the President Office of National Drug Control Policy Barry R. McCaffrey, Director Office of Programs, Budget, Research, and Evaluation For Distribution Summer 1997
E0			 Introduction
E0			Methamphetamine, a powerful central nervous system stimulant, has been  part of  the drug culture for .many years. It was developed early  in this century  from its parent drug amphetamine  and was originally used in nasal decongestants, bronchial inhalers, and in the treatment of narcolepsy and obesity. Legally produced by pharmaceutical houses, amphetamine and methamphetamine were widely available in the 1950s and  '60s through  prescriptions as well as from a booming  black  market.  The Food and Drug Administration estimated in 1962 that over 8 billion tablets were legally produced each year with as much as half of that production going  to unauthorized  users.1  In the 1970s methamphetamine became a Schedule II drug; that is, a drug with little medical use and a high potential for abuse.
E0			"Almost from their first appearance, amphetamine and methamphetamine were abused.  Valued for the ability to keep a user awake for long periods of time and producing a false sense of energy and enhanced physical and mental performance, these drugs were used in the 1950s and early 1960s among groups such as srudents, long distance truckers,  and sports  figures.  In addition  to the tablet  form,  in the late 1960s methamphetamine in crystal or liquid form suitable for injection became popular and the terms ""crystal,"" ""speed"" and ""speed freak"" became part of the drug vernacular."
E0			Increased  Federal  regulation of these drugs produced  important changes in their availability, and the 1970s saw a marked decline  in their use.  Often,  what was sold on the street as methamphetamine was acrually another stimulant  like caffeine or ephedrine.  Illegal dealers began  to rely on domestic illegal laboratories to manufacture supplies for distribution. Highly dangerous, both because of the highly volatile chemicals used in the manufacturing process and the high potential for explosions and fire, methamphetamine production  and distribution  in the 1970s came to be dominated by outlaw motorcycle gangs operating out of mobile clandestine operations in the California and the Pacific Northwest. Methamphetamine use declined nationwide throughout the 1970s, concentrated in a few cities or regions. However, beginning in the late 1980s it appeared to be spreading  from these isolated areas to other new markets and gaining popularity among a larger number of users.
E0			"Methamphetamine is a unique drug.   In its conventional form, it can be snorted, injected  or even eaten. It can also be processed into a potent smokeable form known as ""ice,"" which, starting in Hawaii, gained popularity  in recent years in other areas.  Methamphetamine is both domestically produced and imported into the U.S. in already processed form. Once dominated by local producers in remote areas of California and the Northwest, the market now includes both locals and, increasingly, Mexican sources providing finished product to stateside distributors. For the local producers the processing required to make methamphetamine from precursor  substances  is not only easier  than  it once was, but also more accessible. There are literally thousands of recipes and discussions concerning how to make batches of methainphetamine on the Internet. These entries range from fairly simplistic recipes to highly technical and detailed instructions written by experts."
E0			1 For a complete discussion of the history of amphetamine use see Grinspoon and Hedblom The Speed Culture: Amphetamine Use and Abuse in America, Cambridge MA., Harvard University Press, 1975.
E0			Since its first publication in I992, the Pulse Check has reported  the rise in methamphetamine use in the West and Southwest and the increasing mention of its use in other parts of the country. This special edition of the ONDCP Pulse Check looks at methamphetamine use in six States-New Mexico, Arizona, California, Washington, Oregon and  Hawaii-those  States which appear  to be the hardest  hit by the reappearance of methamphetamine.
E0			For this report, a random sample of treatment providers from the National Drug  Abuse Treatment Unit Survey was taken, and a brief telephone interview with them conducted during the third and fourth weeks of December 1996. A total of 115 treatment providers were interviewed. The geographic distribution of those providers is illustrated in Figure I. In addition; drug ethnographers, researchers and law enforcement  officials in each State  were interviewed.  These sources are listed  in the Appendix. The interview covers topics such as: who is using the drug; how is it used; what other drugs dominate the area; the price of methamphetamine; how is the drug manufactured and sold.
E0			Each State has a unique experience with the re-emergence of methamphetamine. In the sections which follow, we summarize the results of the study by State.
E0			 CALIFORNIA
E0			      For many years methamphetamine abuse was highly localized in specific areas of California, notably San Francisco and San Diego County. In 1990 reports to the Community Epidemiology Work Group, methamphetamine was the most commonly abused drug in the population of persons entering treatment in San Diego. According to the San Diego researcher, in 1996, 45 percent of treatment admissions were due to methamphetamine. In addition, in 1995 arrestees in San Diego represented proportionately more methamphetamine users than at any other Drug Use Forecasting  (DUF) site.  In San Francisco over the past five years, methamphetamine has been consistently  the third  most commonly abused drug of clients admitted to treatment (behind heroin and cocaine) in the five counties that make up San Francisco; much of the abuse in the past was concentrated among the male gay community.   Increases  in other areas and among  a wider spectrum of users has continued  to the present. For example, Los Angeles, not associated with methamphetamine abuse in the past, currently reports that methamphetamine ranks second after cocaine as the primary drug of abuse at admission to treatment and is second nationwide in the number of emergency room mentions related to methamphetamine.
E0			Methamphetamine use in California is still concentrated in some areas, though surveys of treatment providers show a far wider dispersion of the drug's reach than ever before. The mode of ingestion (snorting and smoking versus injection) and the level of involvement of non-local manufacturers and distributors also differs significantly from the northern to the southern parts of the State .
E0			The prevalence of methamphetamine  reported  by all California  sources  reached  for this report is consistent with recent DAWN data which places San Diego, San Francisco,  and  Los Angeles  in the top five cities nationwide in emergency room  mentions  for methamphetamine in 1995.  These  three cities also lead the nation in the number of medical examiner repons (deaths) related  to methamphetamine. There are interesting differences in route of administration reflected in DAWN data between these cities.2 In San Francisco almost two-thirds of the methamphetamine mentions involve injection, whereas in the other two cities only I0-12 percent of mentions involve injection.
E0			"Ethnographic and epidemiologic sources in Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco substantiate the DAWN repons. In San Francisco, ethnographic sources report that methamphetamine, while once most popular in the gay community, is now increasingly used by blue collar workers, young professionals, and college students. Puning methamphetamine into coffee in what is tenned ""biker's coffe. e"" is reported as popular among young profess.ionals interested  in the drug's energizing and appetite suppressant effects, but not interested in snorting or injecting the drug. There are repons that in some segments of the gay community use of methamphetamine is related to ""marathon sex,"" often unprotected, where the drug allows the user to stay awake for long stretches of time. As the DAWN data indicate, in this area it is often injected, doubling the risk of transmission of blood borne viruses and sexually transmitted diseases. 2 These data should be interpreted with caution as they have problerrts due to large numbers of unspecified answers."
E0			" With the wider variety of users now evident, there is also a wider variety of sellers and distributors. While supplies had previously been part of a ""close distribution  network""  when motorcycle clubs dominated production, there are now different kinds of distributors targeting each of the user populations (college students, young professionals, blue collar workers, and the gay and club communities)."
E0			. In Southern California, methamphetamine continues  to be the  number  one or  two drug problem. DUF data indicate that after a slight drop in the number of arrestees testing positive for methamphetamine in San Diego in I995, use rose again in I996, particularly among women  and juveniles. In August 1996, 41 percent of women arrested tested positive for methamphetamine. In September 1995, 5 percent of juvenile male arrestees tested positive for methamphetamine. By September I996 that number had more than doubled to 13 percent. There is also increasing use among Hispanics in this area.
E0			". Methamphetamine in the San Diego area comes from two sources: some ""Mom and Pop"" operations out in rural areas of the county and, more commonly, from Mexican nationals bringing already manufactured methamphetamine across the border. The drug is typically sold in l /4 gram ($20-25), gram ($50-75) and 1/8 ounce ($140-180) units though larger amounts are available. In this area, sources estimate that less than IO percent of users inject, most preferring snorting or smoking the drug."
E0			. Methamphetamine appears to be second only to crack cocaine in popularity in the Los Angeles area. As in San Diego, there is a growing use among Hispanics, though the majority of users are white males. Methamphetamine is available from individual, local manufacturers  in inland  areas like Riverside, but the market is increasingly dominated by established Mexican Nationals with more efficient,  well-organized distribution  routes.  In Los Angeles,  methamphetamine is most often smoked or snorted rather than injected.
E0			. Treatment providers from across the State uniformly report that methamphetamine  is one of their most serious problems.  Treatment  admissions  in  1995 for  methamphetamine abuse San Francisco,  for example,  were double  the 1992 level.   In our survey of providers, 57 percent of  programs report that it is continuing to rise in their area; 25 percent feel that it has stabilized  and 7 percent report it declining. While methamphetamine is a commonly reported drug, it may not be the primary drug problem which brings their clients to treatment. 39 percent of programs  report alcohol as the most common problem among clients at entry into treatment, followed by opiates (18%), methamphetamine (18%), cocaine (14%) and marijuana (11%). However, on average 38 percent of treatment admissions are abusers of methamphetamine. Some programs, like one Northern California adolescent program, report far higher figures: 50 percent of the adolescent clients enter with methamphetamine as their primary drug of abuse and 80 percent report that they regularly use it.
E0			. Who is using methamphetamine? There are two basic profiles of users reported by treatment providers: I) students, both high school and college age, males and females, and 2) white, blue collar workers or unemployed persons in their twenties.
E0			 Several providers in Southern California also mention an increase in the number of Hispanic methamphetamine users, though whites still appear  to dominate this user group.  They are also likely to be users of alcohol and marijuana along with methamphetamine rather than users of drugs like heroin.
E0			For example, two methadone  programs  reported  that less than  10 percent of their clients enter treatment reporting that they use methamphetamine. In contrast, programs where alcohol or marijuana are the primary drugs of abuse at entry report that as many as 70-80 percent of their clients also use methamphetamine. 61 percent of treatment providers also felt that there was some substirution of methamphetamine for the less accessible and more expensive cocaine, but many also noted that methamphetamine has a clear following of its own.
E0			What prompts methamphetamine users to enter treatment?  Methamphetamine can cause a variety of mental, physical, and social problems which may prompt entry into treatment.  Though  it is not as expensive as heroin or cocaine, its cost might also produce financial problems for users and prompt them to seek help. Because so many clients in treatment for methamphetamine abuse are also unemployed, one might assume that it could eventually  produce difficulties on the job.  It is interesting to note, however, that the most commonly reported reason methamphetamine clients enter treatment is trouble with the law. 46 percent of programs  report that legal problems are the most common  reasons for entry; 29 percent report mental or emotional problems most common and  14 percent  report problems on the job or at school.
E0			". Several providers also describe methamphetamine abusers as ""the.hardest to treat."" They are often overly excitable and ""extremely resistant to any form of intervention once the acute effects of meth use have gone away,"" e.g., malnourishment, depression, chronic sleeplessness, headaches."
E0			WASHINGTON STATE
E0			. For the information concerning methamphetamine in Washington State, two law enforcement officials, a drug researcher at the University of Washington, and a random sample of 16 treatment providers around the State were interviewed.
E0			. In addition, we reviewed  1995 DAWN data, available only for Seattle.  DAWN data indicate a 7 percent increase from 1994-1995 in the number of medical examiner mentions for Seattle, about 4 . percent of all ME deaths reported for 1995. Of the 10,729 ER mentions for Seattle in 1995, approximately 3 percent involved methamphetamine.
E0			 All sources describe a rising trend in methamphetamine availability and use, though problems with heroin and cocaine are still dominant in the urban areas of the State. Epidemiologic data indicate that there has been a 252 percent increase in the number of treatment admissions  with methamphetamine as the primary drug of abuse between 1992 and 1995.  The overwhelming  majority of methamphetamine admissions are of whites (almost 90%); 40 percent are in their late twenties and early thirties and 37 percent are injecting the drug.
E0			 Epidemiologic sources point out that while the majority of users continues to be rural bikers and blue collar workers, there are also a number of other  groups now using.  For example,  it is reported that the drug is becoming increasingly popular among street youth, among Native American populations and among Hispanic immigrants. This source describes this as a diffusion from rural to urban, from gay populations to heterosexuals and from white to minorities.
E0			" Sellers and manufacturers in Washington State, including both local residents and Mexican Nationals, are reported to be increasing in number. One Seattle law enforcement source describes the increase in distribution and use as ""remarkable in the last 18 months."" The increase in the number of prosecutions from seven in 1991 to 52 in 1995 indicate the growth in the sheer number of dealers."
E0			"Labs are reported as springing up in a variety of places: hotels, motels, backrooms of other facilities. DEA sources report that, as in California, Mexican meth dealers are using the same routes and distributors for meth as they use or have used for heroin and cocaine. This source also reports the practice of ""eating"" meth; that is, putting it on paper or food and chewing it, though injecting and snorting are the most common modes of ingestion."
E0			 Among treatment providers interviewed around the State, 94 percent reported that methamphetamine use is increasing in their area. The remaining 6 percent report that it has stabilized. Though no programs reported that methamphetamine use  was the primary drug of abuse for most of their clients at treatment entry, on average,  approximately  30 percent of those  in treatment use the drug. As is reported in California, the most common reason cited for meth  using clients to seek treatment is trouble with the law (50%), followed by mental and family problems.
E0			" There is a wider variety of methods of using methamphetamine in the Washington area than in some of the other States. Providers report  that clients are equally  likely  to smoke,  inject, or  snort it. 81 percent of Washington treatment providers also reported that methamphetamine is substituting  for the more expensive and far less accessible cocaine. Almost 70 percent reported that use is up because methamphetamine is cheap and/or readily available throughout the State. Methamphetamine, like marijuana, is considered a ""local"" or ""homemade"" drug."
E0			" Who is using meth in Washington State? The typical user is described as white, high school educated, in his or her twenties and  thirties, and a blue collar or service  worker.  Several  providers stress that this is not someone who also uses heroin and cocaine. Two directors of Seattle  programs which serve  heroin  users state that less than 5  percent of  their clients use methamphetamine.  Most often the companion  drugs used  by  methamphetamine users are alcohol and  marijuana.  As one provider comments, ""It is the alcohol that brings them in here. Once in treatment, we see the problems with speed, pot, and hallucinogens."""
E0			OREGON
E0			" All sources describe methamphetamine as a ""continuing problem"" in Oregon. Methamphetamine has been part of the drug scene there since the !960s-a part that did not disappear completely as it did in many other areas of the country. Oregon has also been one of the States with steady activity in the production of methamphetamine and distribution to other areas of the West. Whereas other States may report only a handful of laboratory busts or supply seizures over the last twenty years, Oregon law enforcement reports consistent activity surrounding the drug."
E0			 DAWN data from medical examiners in Portland indicates a decline in deaths due to methamphetamine from 1994-1995. Similarly, data gathered from police sources in Eugene, regional DEA agents and treatment providers indicates that, while there may be some stabilization, methamphetamine use is still a major drug problem in the State.
E0			" Law enforcement sources report that methamphetamine continues to plague the area. July of 1995 brought one of the largest laboratory busts in an area of rural Oregon where manufacrurers were producing as much as 100 pounds of methamphetamine per batch. This bust led to related police action involving distributors across the Canadian border. While a portion of the drug is still produced locally, police sources report that currently the bulk of the supply now comes from California and Mexico. Production of methamphetamine is described as having ""always been around"" in rural Oregon. However, it is now no longer just a local operation managed by a handful of producers in small labs."
E0			" Treatment providers throughout the State describe methamphetamine as a problem. 47 percent of those interviewed reported that methamphetamine is the primary drug of abuse of their clients, followed by 40 percent reporting alcohol and 13 percent reporting marijuana as the primary problem. A average of 52 percent of clients across all programs use methamphetamine. In one small rural Oregon town, the treatment director commented that these are areas where ""people don't use cocaine-wouldn't think of it-but speed is widely accepted, particularly among 18-25 year  olds."" Another program which dealt only with adolescents reports that only 10 percent come into treatment with meth as the primary problem (that is usually alcohol or marijuana), but 70-80 percent use it. Many providers also commented on its availability due to ""homemade"" sources. 80 percent of providers reported the prevalence of meth in their area as due primarily to its low cost and/or wide availability."
E0			 Who is using meth in Oregon? The typical Oregon user is quite similar to that reported in other States: white, often. male, a blue collar worker now unemployed, in his/her rwenties and early thirties. Adolescent programs also report methamphetamine use among srudents, sometimes. as young as ninth graders.  The most common  reason for treatment entry  is legal troubles.  The most common method of ingestion in this area is snorting, followed by injecting and, to a far lesser degree, smoking.
E0			ARIZONA
E0			".  Like Southern California, Arizona has reported problems with methamphetamine use and trafficking for several years. Sitting at the southwest border, Arizona has been struggling with the traffic in what one source described as ""first the makings for the cake (chemicals) and now the cake itself (processed methamphetamine)"" for many years."
E0			. DAWN data indicate that Phoenix ranks third nationwide in the number of methamphetamine  ER mentions in 1995 with 732 mentions, about 10 percent of all Phoenix ER mentions, though this number has been decreasing over the last few years. Medical examiner data from Phoenix is also somewhat encouraging, indicating a substantial decline (29%) in the number of deaths attributable to methamphetamine. Approximately 42 percent of these mentions involve smoking of the drug, the most common method reported in the State by all sources.
E0			". Ethnographic sources report that methamphetamine in both urban and rural areas is a widely prevalent, and may be increasingly popular among young users where ""it has not received the attention cocaine has; does not have the 'mystique' cocaine  has.""  Users tend  to be either  White,  rural  blue collar workers who have used the drug for many years or urban cocaine users who are switching to methamphetamine. The latter users are described as people who can not get cocaine and/or those who burn out on the drug and ""need the stronger, longer lasting and cheaper high meth can provide."" The problem noted by this source is that users burn out even faster often developing even higher levels of paranoia or other dysfunctional behavior than they experience with cocaine."
E0			". Law enforcement sources in Phoenix report that methamphetamine continues as the ""drug of choice"" in Arizona,  the number one street  trafficking  drug problem.  Though  this source describes adult use as stabilizing somewhat, like the ethnographic source,  he feels that adolescent  use appears to be increasing as adolescents ""feel more confident of its safety,"" perceiving it safer than cocaine. These users are more likely to snort the drug, though some are injecting."
E0			 Street level trade in methamphetamine is brisk in Phoenix. Prices range from $20-$25 for a 1/4 gram unit to $160-$180 for 1/8 ounce.  Sellers tend  to be U.S. citizens selling  their own  local  product or Mexican nationals selling  methamphetamine produced  across the border.  Many  local labs continue to spring up in the area and it is estimated that police uncover one or even two a week.
E0			 Of the 24 Arizona treatment providers interviewed, 71 percent felt that methamphetamine use was up in their area, overwhelmingly (72%) because it is cheap and/or available. While alcohol (46%) and cocaine (17%) are the primary drugs of abuse at entry in most programs, methamphetamine (13%) ranks third. In addition, these programs report an average of 40 percent of their clientele using methamphetamine at entry. Smoking and snorting the drug are most common routes of administration.
E0			 As in other States, providers in Arizona report troubles with  the law (63%) as the most common catalyst to treatment entry, followed by family problems (21%) and financial problems (8%). Most of the clients they see who are abusing methamphetamine are young (twenties) and either unemployed or employed in a blue collar occupation. While the typical user is still currently white, several providers noted the increase in methamphetamine abuse among young Hispanics and Native American populations. Urban areas like Phoenix and Tucson also reported the popularity of methamphetamine among the gay population due its image as an enhancer of sexual stamina.
E0			NEW MEXICO
E0			"Law enforcement sources in New Mexico report that methamphetamine is readily available in that State, both from heavy trafficking across the border and from the local operations which spring up, particularly in rural or remote areas. Though  there are many  ""match  book"" or  ""do-it-yourself' operations in the area, the bulk of the supplies to New Mexico come from the larger and more efficient Mexican based  producers.  The number of seizures of methamphetamine has increased dramatically since the early 1990s, including an almost 700 pound seizure in New Mexico in 1994."
E0			"The demand is both the traditional older  ""biker""  users as well as former cocaine and crack users switching to the cheaper, longer lasting high. When cocaine is available,  it is preferred  by many of these users.  This source reports that in fact, many  users buy  methamphetamine marketed  as cocaine."
E0			Half of the 16 treatment providers interviewed  report  that  metharnphetamine  use has increased in the past year, while 44 percent report that it has stabilized  in their areas.  Three-fourths of the programs report that the primary drug of abuse at entry for most of their clients is alcohol, followed by opiates (13%). No program  reported  that the majority of their clients  report  methamphetamine as the primary drug problem, and the average proportion of clients using meth at entry is 27 percent.
E0			"Several providers report that the stabilization in use is due to crackdowns on local labs in their area as well as a rise in the popularity of heroin in the State. Methamphetamine is described as widely available, however. As one provider commented, ""They think they won't become addicted and it is cheaper than anything but pot."" Programs in remote or very rural areas of the State often report users who value the drug for its ability  to keep them  working on farms or in oil fields for long  periods of time allowing them to accumulate extra or overtime pay. Too often, that pay is spent on the common companion or primary drug problem, alcohol."
E0			The typical users in New Mexico are white, unemployed, and in their twenties. They are as likely to snort the drug as they are to inject it. As in the other States, the most common reason for seeking treatment among meth abusers is trouble with the law. One provider describes a  male client who abuses alcohol and methamphetamine and routinely gets into brawls as a result. The aggression produced by inebriation, heightened by the paranoia and sense of physical prowess produced by methamphetamine, combine to make him a regular with the local authorities. Methamphetamine also, however, makes him a difficult arrestee to manage in small facilities.
E0			HAWAII
E0			"Sources in Hawaii report the greatest prevalence of methamphetamine use and the widest  range in types of  users of all the States surveyed.  Most often  in  the smokeable crystalline  form called  ""ice"" in the mainland but a number of other names in Hawaii, methamphetamine is reported among whites, Asians, males and females, srudents, blue collar workers, and professionals. It is smoked in expensive glass pipes, mixed with tobacco, or even in pipes made from soda cans."
E0			Drug research sources in Honolulu report that while methamphetamine has wide appeal in that area, it is also associated with violent episodes and difficulty in successful treatment. In a srudy in the early 1990s, 40 percent of prisoners admitted to local facilities had used methamphetamine. Sources of  the drug are both local and from other areas in the Pacific, though the drug is distributed and readily available through local dealers of other drugs like cocaine and heroin.
E0			"69 percent of treatment providers interviewed felt that methamphetami""ne use had increased over the past year and 25 percent felt it was stabilizing. It is the primary drug of abuse at entry for 38 percent of programs interviewed, second only to alcohol (44%) and followed by marijuana (19%). An average of 55 percent of the clients at entry use methamphetamine, and, as in other States, it is trouble with the law which prompts them to seek treatment most of the time (44%). Several providers receive clients through employee assistance programs which refer employees who have exhibited inappropriate or aggressive behavior on the job or chronic absenteeism."
E0			"The typical user profile is harder to draw for Hawaii. While many programs  report that users  are young (teens and twenties), there is a range of jobs, ethnicities, and education levels reported. No program reports that clients inject; users either smoke methamphetamine (81 %) or inhale it (25%). A commonly reported problem in treating these clients is that they ""rarely admit to methamphetamine abuse. They will tell you about ""huffing"" (inhalant abuse) if they are kids or about alcohol if they are adults, but fail to mention the meth until Yllll ask them."" Methamphetamine users do, however, need extended treatment, according to several treatment providers,  particularly  if they  have been smoking for a year or more."
E0			SUMMARY
E0			Methamphetamine abuse is a continuing problem in these Western states and in Hawaii. While the drug has been used in these States for many years by a small number of users, it has gradually become the drug of choice and primary drug of abuse at entry to treatment in many areas, even overtaking the more common drug problems of heroin and cocaine in treatment populations. Even in areas where alcohol is cited as the most common treatment problem, methamphetamine is often the companion drug, along with marijuana, in anywhere from 25 to 80 percent of the cases.
E0			"Methamphetamine is a drug with particular appeal to students and  to blue collar workers, using it for recreation, to increase job or school performance, or simply to stay energized for long periods of time.  It is cheaper and  more accessible  than cocaine and appears  not to have the same stigma associated with  it.  As one ethnographer comments,  ""These users are too young  to remember  the 'Speed Kills' campaigns of the late 60s and early 70s, and  seem  to think  it is pretty  harmless.""  It can be injected, snorted,  smoked or even eaten,  making  it more versatile drug to administer.   However, it  is also a drug which has high burnout potential. Treatment providers in all States report users enter treatment more rapidly with methamphetamine than with either heroin or cocaine."
E0			One particularly interesting finding from these surveys is the uniformity of response in terms of why users decide to enter treatment. Over 50 percent of providers in each State cited legal problems as  the catalyst for most of their methamphetamine clients' entry into treatment. These legal problems are described as aggressive behaviors like fighting or  bizarre or inappropriate  behaviors which prompt others to call  the police.  Police sources also note that arrestees  under  the influence of methamphetamine are some of the most difficult to manage due to high levels of hostility, paranoia and agitation.
E0			This report also finds that methamphetarnine is readily available in these six States. It is both locally manufactured by small producers operating in a variety of places and using recipes widely circulated in the drug culture and, increasingly (on the U.S. mainland), manufactured  and distributed by Mexican nationals through local networks already established in the distribution of other drugs. This more efficient routing may be in part responsible for its increased popularity. in many areas.

E0			Pulse Check Methodology
E0			Since its first publication in 1992, the Pulse Check  has provided  the  most  current  intelligence about drug markets and patterns of drug abuse nation-wide. The Pulse Check draws on discussions with ethnographers and epidemiologists working in the drug field, law enforcement agents, and drug treatment providers across the country. Approximately  seventy-five people are called for each report.
E0			Ethnographers, Epidemiologists, and other Ethnographic Sources
E0			"Ethnography is a mode ofresearch that analyzes the behavior of groups in the natural settings in which these behaviors occur. Ethnographers use field observations and interviews to gather data. Ethnography is not undercover work. Rather, the ethnographer, who is fully revealed as a social science researcher, enters the drug user's world to record and describe it ""on its own terms,"" that is, without predetermined ideas."
E0			Epidemiologists are also consulted for the Pulse Check. Epidemiologists study the origins, spread, and control of diseases, in a general public health paradigm. In the field of substance abuse, they track changes in patterns of drug use, including the incidence and prevalence of the use of specific drugs, characteristics of users, and emerging trends. Many epidemiologists who report for the Pulse Check are members of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Community Epidemiology Working Group (CEWG).
E0			 Other ethnographers, such as sociologists and psychologists who use ethnographic research techniques, also are included as sources for the Pulse Check.
E0			 The ethnographic sources contacted by Pulse Check include some of the best known drug researchers in the country. In some cases, they are trained ethnographers; in other cases, they are epidemiologists with access to ethnographic information; a few are social researchers working in a field site collecting ethnographic data. Reporters are generally the same for each round of calls.
E0			The following twelve ethnographers, epidemiologists, and other ethnographic sources from urban areas were contacted for this issue of Pulse Check:
E0			 Austin, TX: Jane Maxwell, M.A. Director of Needs Assessment Department, Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse.
E0			 Bridgeport, CN: Garry Geter. Addictions Counselor, Connecticut Department of Health.
E0			 Chicago, IL: Wayne Weibel, Ph.D.  Associate Professor of Epidemiology and Director of

E0			 San Diego, CA: Susan Pennell, M.A. Director, Criminal Justice Research Division, San Diego Association of Governments.
E0			 Trenton/Newark, NJ: John French, M.A. Chief Epidemiologist, New Jersey Department of Public Health.
E0			Police Sources
E0			Police sources are drawn from the Abt staffs existing contacts within law enforcement and from contacts developed through the recommendations of law enforcement agencies. These sources are typically officers working on special squads, narcotics task forces, and DEA agents.
E0			This issue of Pulse Check reached police sources in six cities. Reporters are generally the same for each round of calls; however, when police contacts must change as officers take on new positions, replacements are typically made on the recommendation of the officer who had been the Pulse Check reporter.
E0			. Treatment Providers
E0			 The sample of treatment providers is derived from the National Facility Register, a directory of treatment programs compiled by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration, from which this sample from the Uniform Facility Data Set (formerly the
E0			 National Drug Abuse Treatment Unit Survey) is drawn within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.    The listings are divided  into four regions that  have a similar  number of treatment programs and are treated  equally  for sampling.  The states in each  region  are listed below.
E0			        ◦ Regio11 I: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Vennont, Pennsylvania
E0			        ◦ Region II: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, Washington, D.C., West Virginia
E0			        ◦ Region Ill: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Wisconsin, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota
E0			        ◦ Region IV: Colorado, Montana, Utah, Wyoming, Nevada, Arizona, California, Idaho, New Mexico, Washington, Oregon
E0			This Pulse Check incorporates the comments of 61 treatment providers. From each of the four regions listed above, 20 large (over 100 clients) programs and 20 small (under 100 clients) programs were identified, 10 to 15 of each type were contacted, and the remaining 5 served as replacements. The samples are stratified to include equal numbers oflarge and small programs.

D0			Bruce, Elena, Rahm:
D1			After reviewing the draft Meth and drug testing, here are my reactions:
D1			    1. Meth report shows our strategy is working. Subst ve and newsworthy items include: (1) preliminary '96 data show that  meth use is down fron\ZJo  52 percent  in  most  cities;  (2) clandestine lab seizures have increased 170% (from 326 in '95 to 879 in '96), and '97 seizures are escalating; (3) increased meth penalties recently released by Sentencing Commission and will take effect on 11/1/97; and (4) good, recent anecdotes on successful prosecutions -- including life for meth dealers -- and lab seizures. ·
D1			The report also discusses state and local cooperation, law enforcement training, treatment, meth awareness campaign, improved efforts from Mexico (1 ton of precursor chemicals seized last year), and precursor chemicals.
D1			    2. Update on Operation Drug TEST not ready. The report on drug testing still needs considerable work. Problems include: (1) more than a year later, not all 25 cities bave program r11nninq (only 19); (2) no numbers/impact to reporJ.i (3) mostly a re-hash of original EO and proposed guidelines -­ essentially o anecdotes; and (4) does not address issue of  treatment -- to what extent are we treating offenders that test positive?
D1			"Rec: Play up the meth report and Treasury's GTO; hold the drug testing report. Also, get with DOJ on improving the criminal justice drug testing/treatment report. It's too important an anti-drug and crime initiative to get such short shrift. Here are some initial thoughts on improving the report: • ,1 ? (1) Focus on cost-benefit of testing/treatment, along the lines of new RAND report; (2) broaden to - '-'""'-,. include state and local efforts, like crime bill-funded ""drug courts""; and (3) included new actions with reports -- Drug Testing Czar (in Dennis memo)? Directive/guidelines for states to adopt c6mprehensTve testing/treatment? Push for testing/treatment dollars in juvie bill? Release of drug court funds? I follow-up on these and check DB's files for more. I know he was talking to Mark Kleiman about some ideas."

E0			National Methamphetamine Strategy Update May 1997 CLINTON LIBRARY PHOTOCOPY
E0			Message to the President
E0			One year ago, in Miami, you announced our new methamphetamine strategy. It encompasses a tough but fair and balanced approach to this national problem. Those who violate the law must be caught and punished, while we must do all that we can to prevent the manufacture and trafficking of this poison.
E0			We are already beginning to see results. We are beginning to turn the corner.   Methamphetamine use_ is down in almost all cities where it is sampled. But, we must not let up. First, we must prevent the further spread of this scourge and second, we must continue to work until we have eliminated the problem.
E0			 While we are making this report to you, we are only doing so as representatives of men and women in federal, state, county and local government and the private sector. They have done the work and they deserve the credit.

E0			NATIONAL METHAMPHETAMINE STRATEGY UPDATE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY.
E0			Methamphetamine: The Challenge.
E0			Methamphetamine is a synthetic stimulant drug thal is cheaper than cocaine in many markets. produces a longer high than cocaine, and can produce extreme aggressiveness and irrational violence.
E0			"Methamphetamine use is spreading. Use of the drug  has  hislorically  been concentrated  in the West and Southwest. It is now spreading to the Midwest and to e East. Left unchecked, methamphewn.ine could become the ''crack"" cocaine of the 1990s, with even more devastating results."
E0			 Metbamphetamine production carries senre environmental risks. Methamphetamine is produced in clandestine laboratories, which carry an enonnously high risk of fire and explosion. The product.ion process creates large amounts of extremely toxic waste, much of which is dumped into waterways or on the ground. Officers investigating laboratories have been overwhelmed by chemicals, and the cost of cleaning up a single laboratory is often in the thousands of dollars.
E0			    I. The Administration S Response.
E0			 National Methamphetamine Strategy. The President's National Methamphetamine Stralegy addresses the emerging methamphetamine threat and provides the underpinnings for a coordinated govcmment wide response.
E0			 Legislation. With the Administration·s leadership. Congress enacted the Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996 last October. The Act strengthens criminal penalties for methamphetamine trafficking and establishes new controls over precursor chemicals.
E0			 Law Enforcement. The Administration has stepped up its effons to help law enforcement deal with methamphetamine trafficking, specifically:
E0			 By enhancing the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF) effon;
E0			 By designating a Midwest High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) to meet the methamphetamine threat in Nebraska, Iowa. Kansas, Missouri, and South Dakota:
E0			 By requesting that all U.S. Attorneys submit district plans assessing the current 1hreat and establishing coordination groups among community agencies, which was completed as of September 1996; and
E0			 By successfully investigating and prosecuting numerous criminal methamphetamine cases, in close coordination with the slate and local law enforcement agencies.
E0			 Improving Intelligence  Products and  Information  Sharing.  The Administration is reviewing the way intelligence and information is acquired, processed, and utilized in regard to the production, transportation, and sale of precursor chemicals, the manufacture, import.alien, and distribution of methamphetamine, and the laundering of profi derived from methamphetamine sales.
E0			 Prevention and Education. The Department of Education is developing material related to the prevention of methamphetamine use and will send the material  to all local education. agencies by September 30, I997.
E0			 TrealmenL Currently used psychosocial and cognitive-behavioral drug abuse treatment approaches are effective in reducing methamphetamine abuse. Research on drug abuse pharmacotherapies, as well as behavioral treatments, is continuing.
E0			 Data Collection. The National Institute of Justice's Dr11g Use Forecasting Report is adding substantial data to its banks of information on methamphetaminc abuse. In addition. NIJ is sponsoring research on methamphetam..ine distribution and market patterns in five western cities. The National Institutes of Health are also conducting an in-depth study of the methamphetaminc user. Preliminary findings from this study will be shared at an upcoming national mcthamphetamine conference.
E0			 Conferences. The Administration has hosted  two methamphetamine conferences  -  one regional and one national in scope - which drew more than 450 people representing a broad array of disciplines from all over the country. These conferences are the primary forums for sharing information. increasing understanding. coordinating effons. and soliciting input to improve the nation's response to the methamphetarnine problem.
E0			 Publications. The Office of National Drug Control Policy published two documents in January 1997 on methamphetamine - Pulse Check: Metlw.mphetamine Trends in Five Western States and Hawaii and Rticent DAWN Data on Methamphetamine and Speed.
E0			 Putting the Issue before the American People. The Administration has highlighled  the nature of the methamphetamine threat through public announcements. policy statements, media events, and meetings with coalitions at all levels of American society, and we plan to continue to do so in a varie1y of ways, including a proposed $175 million national advenising campaign.
E0			 Strategy Review. The Administration is continually reviewing and C\'alualing the effectiveness of the Kational Me1hamphetamine Strategy. Building upon its foundation. the 1998 National Drug Control Strategy will incorporate budget entries to update the action items of the National Methamphetamine Strategy.
E0			 REPORT ON METHAMPHETAMINE ABUSE AND TRAFFICKING IN THE UNITED STATES: An Update of the National Methamphetamine Strategy
E0			 Introduction.
E0			"The trafficking and abuse of methamphetamine - a highly destructive. addictive. and violence­ ausing synthetic drug - continues to be a national problem. Melhamphetamine. also known on the ireet as ..crystal ,"" ""crank."" ""ice ,"" and ""speed ,"" is a dangerous synthetic stimulant !hat results in an ddiction cycle and physiological trauma similar 10 that associated ""''ilh ""crack"" cocaine use. ,1ethamphetarnine may be injected. smoked, snorted, or ingested orally, making it increasingly attrac­ ive to casual usei, ."
E0			l. Historical Background.
E0			Until the early 1990s. methampheiamine trafficking was largely associated with motorcycle gangs who supplied users in various pans of the United States . A,·ailable data show that in the last few year.;, 1buse has risen significantly in the West and Southwest portions of the country. The Drug Use Forecasting DUF) siatistics released by lhe National Institute of Justice (NU) in July 1996 confirmed that rnethamphei:a• nine use was highest in western locales. According to lhe Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN), between 1989 and 1995. the estimated number of nationu•ide emergency-room drug abuse episodes involving nelhampheiamine doubled, and between 1991 and 1994. the number ofmethamphetamine deaths  nearly ripled.
E0			 The metharnphetamine problem has been spreading into the Midwest and eastward into states such as !\rkansas. Georgia. and Florida. For example. between 199:? and 1996 , the Midwest region (Missouri. Iowa, Kansas. South Dakota, and Nebraska) saw a 300 percent increase in clandestine laboratory seizures, and in 1996 , the Drug Enforcemem Administrdtion (DEA) seized 236 clandestine methamphetamine labo­ ratories in Missou ri alon e.
E0			 Unlike the cocaine busines s where Mexican traffickers are forced 10 rely upon their Colombian counter­ pans as primary suppliers . the Me ican organizations need  not depend  upon  ouiside sources 10  manufac­ ture methamphctamine . One the  precursor c hemicals  are obtained.  Me ican  organiza tions control  a.II links of the production. transportation. and distribution chains -  and lherc fore,  unfonunatdy.  gain  vinu  al• ly all of the illicit profits . The Mexican organizations that dominate wholesale methamphei:amine tr.1iiick­ ing arc capabk of producing unprecedented quantities of high-purity mcthamphcumunc in large-scale labo• ratorlcs .
E0			 Melhamphetamine also poses a unique public health and environmental hazard because of the na1Ure of ; manufacturing process. The toxic  propenies  associated  with  chemicals  in  and  around  me1hampheta­ ine laboratories introduce special health risks 10 law enforcement agents and the neighboring public: the .cendiary and ell plosive nature of these chemicals funher adds to the public safety ris ks. The se hazards 1d challenges warrant special precautions and training.
E0			  '. The Adminislralion's Response.
E0			 As a result of this growing methamphetamine threat. in February 1996, the Ad minis tration organized nd coortlinated a National Methamphetamine Conference in Arlington. Virginia to raise the public aware­ ess of the increasing problem. Over 200 representatives from feder al. slate , and local law enforcement gencies nationwide panicipated in the Confe rence, and for three days, ellpens shared their experiences. uccesses. and setbacks in their fight against methamphctaminc abuse and trafficking .
E0			 In response to the methamphetamine threat, the President released the National Methamphetamine ,trategy (the Strategy) in April 1996 . The Strategy assesses the methamphetamine threat, identifies the ssues, and draws an action plan to aven the spread of methamphewnine, which, if unchecked, could reach :pidcmic proponions .
E0			 The Strategy incorporates the recommendations from a broad spectrum of the law enforcement commu- 1ity. It also recognizes that in order lo tackle the methamphctamine and precursor chemicals proble m, the 3ovemment must adopt a multi-disciplinary approach, including legislation, law enforcement, training. :hemical regulation, international cooperation, environmental protection, education. and treatment. fherefore, the Strategy called upon the collective wealth of ellperience and ellpenise of the Depanments of Defense, Education . Health and Human Services_, J ustice. State, Treasury. the Environmental Protection Agency, the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), and other noted npens and scholars.
E0			 II. The Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996.
E0			 Based upon the Administration's initiative . Congress took an imponant s1ep when ii enac1ed the Comprehensive Methamphe1aminc Control Act of 1996 (the Ac1), which wa s signed into law on October 3, 1996 . The Act incorpora1es many elements that had been suggesled in lhe Na1ional Me1hamphetamme Strategy, including increased penalties and regulatory provisions for precursor chemicals.
E0			 Specifically, the Act directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to increase penalties for traffick.ing in methamphetam.ine and precursor chemicals to reflect the nature of such offenses . their relati, ·c  harm  to society. and the need for aggressive law enforcement action. It also requests 1hat the Com miss ion consida significant penalty enhancements for laboratory operators who mishandle ignita ble. corro sive. reac1i ve. and toxic chemicals so as to pose a risk 10 public safet y and the environment.
E0			 In late April 1997. the Commission adopted amendments (I) to increase the basic penalties for mctham ­ phetamine traffick.ing in cenain cases: (2) to provide an enhancemen1 for the imponation of methamphet3· mine or the manufacture of methamphetaminc from unlawfully impon ed che mica ls: and (3) to enhance penalties for the unlawful discharge. emission. or relca.,e of a hazardous or !Ollie substance or the unlawful transponalion, 1reatmem. storage . or disposal of a hazardous wa. te. These amendments to the Sentencing 4 Guidelines will take effect on November I, 19 97, unless an act of Congress  provides otherwise.  Earlier  in the year. the Commission had adopted emergency guideline amendments to increase  pcnalties for traffick­ ing in methamphet.amine precursor chemicals.
E0			 The Act also includes tighter controls on retail sales of drug products containing key precursor chemi­ cals: ephedrine, pseudoephedrinc or phenylpropanolamine . Because methamphetamine must be synthe­ sized from precursor chemicals, regulatory comrol of a select group of chemicals can impede clandestine domestic production of the drug.
E0			 Ill. Methamphetamine: A Top Law Enforcement Priority.
E0			 The Administration continues to place methamphet.amine e forcement efforts as a top priority. We must continue our cooperative partnerships among federal, state, and local agencies and  organizations.  There should be continued frank and candid conversations to discuss openly  the difficulties faced  by ea.ch  region of the country.
E0			 In 1996, at the request of the Attorney General. each U.S. Auomey assessed the m,:thamphetamine problem in her/his district and together with the federal, state, and local agencies. came up with a plan 10 address the problem. In some cases - particularly. in the Midwest and California - the U.S. Anomeys developed regional s trategies .
E0			 In addition, law enforcement agencies continue to develop intelligence and information on trafficking organizations and clandestine laboratories to assist in the  monitoring  of shipments of  methamphetamine and its precursor chemicals - with a special emphasis on major violent methamphetamine trafficking orga­ nizations.  Based  upon this information,  federal, state . and local law enforcemem  agencies are selecting and pursuing the highest-level and most dangerous targets.
E0			 The Administration is also addressing public safety issues connected with the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine . The environmental dangers presented by manufacturers of methamphetamine and the explosive potentialities pose significant hazards to private citizens and law enforcement personnd.
E0			 A sad example of the dangers of methamphetamine production  occurred  in  Perris. California  on  April 19, 1997, when a fire exploded in a trailer home seriously burning two young children, ages 4 and 6. The investigators determined  that  the fire \I/as most likely caused by the mo1her of the two children. auempting to ex1ract pseudoephedrine from certain phannaceutical tablets. The mother was subsequently arrested and charged with m:inufacturing m.:thamphetamirn: and  four counts of child  endangerment, and  more  than 1,400 bottles of pseudoephedrine were s.:ized by law enforcement authorities from the scene.
E0			 In Dec.:mber 1995 . a similar incidem occurred in which Kathy James watched as her three children - Dion (3 years). Jackson (2 years) and Megan (I years) - perished in an explosion and fire at an illicit methamphetamine laboratory in Aguanga, California.  The family's  mobile  hom.: \\'as demolished  as a result of the activities of Kathy James and two males, Harry Jensen and Michael Tulh.:rt. operating a clan­ destine methamphetamine laboratory. The three adults \I/ere hospitalized for bums and smoke inhalation, :ind traces of methamphetamine were found in the mother' s bloodstre.im. Kathy James was subsequently charged withsecond-degree murder :ind  manufacture  of a controlled  substance, and Jensen and Talben were charged with manufacturing a controlled substance and conspiracy.
E0			 In the same month, a methampheiamine laboratory using propane iuel caused $3.5 million worth of property damage to a motel near Bums . Oregon. The fire quickly spread to the walls and roof of the adjoining four-building complex. and all 122 rOOIT15 of the motel were destroyed. Fortunately , no guests were injured in the mishap: however. it could have been much worse since the motel was located directly across the s!It:et from Bum s High School.
E0			 These types of dangers must be addressed - not only by law enforcement authorities - but also in cooperation with public health and safety officials.
E0			    A. Drug Enforcemenl Administration lniJialives.
E0			 The DEA. in panicular, has demonstrated its commitment to combat the spread of methamphetamine uafficking and abuse by undertaking significant law enforcement and educational effo rts . DEA Clandestine Laboratory Enforcement Teams seiz.ed 879 clandestine methamphetamine laboratories - a 170 percent increase over the number of laboratories seized (326) in 1995. Current projections indicate that an even higher number of seizures will be achieved in 19'

E0			" In addition, the Special Operations Division run by DEA. Federal Bureau of ln""es1igation (FBI). and U.S. Customs Service (USCS), since April 1996, has funded or assisted in approximately 80 major metham­ phetamine investigations of Mexican targelS. Many of these investigations involve the use of extensive coun-authorized electronic survei llance and ocher sophisticaced invest igative techniques."
E0			 DEA has also provided subs1antial suppon 10 slate and  local  law enforcemenl  agencies  in combaning the distribution of me1hamphe1amine on our streets. DEA. in response to a request  by a county  sheriff. placed lhe Mobile Enforcement Terun in a rural Nebrask.a community to focus exclusively on mc1hamphc1- amine investigations. The  DEA Domestic  Operations Section  also instituted  a Special  Enforcement Program entitled Operation VELOCITY which target5 major methamphetarnine organizations. as well as independenl traffickers in the United Stales . The DEA Office of Diversion Control iniliated a priority lar· geting system named Operation BACKTRACK which 1arge1S rogue chemical companies that supply clan­ destine metharnphetamine laboratories.
E0			 Also. DEA, in conjunction  with the California Bureau of Narcotics  Enforcement  (BNE). the Western State Intelligence Network. and the El Paso Intelligence Ce nter. continues to work 10 establish a National Clandestine Laboratory Data Base, which will assist all law enforcement agencies in metharnphetamine investigations and provide a national perspective on clandestine laborato ries, based upon input from all law enforcement agencies. DEA has formulated plans  to  purchase  new safety equipment, such as air monito rs. air purified respirators. laboratory trucks, fire-resistant clothing. and other tactical clothing  for DEA agents and state and local officers who raid clandestine laboratories .
E0			    B. U.S. Customs Sen>iu lnilialiYes.
E0			 In May 1988. USCS initiated Operation CHEMCON. whose objectives arc to identify shipments oi precursor and essential chemicals that originate from or transit  major chemical  pons  in  the  United  States and determine what ponion of these exported chemicals were being illegally di\'ened to clandes1ine labora­ tories. Since January 1996.  the  Clean  Air Act  has prohibited  the  production,  purchase. sale, impon. or expon of freon into or outside the United  States; freon  is emerging an  imporumt  solvent  in the  production of metharnphetamine.
E0			 USCS is developing an au1omated expon sys1em database for domestic and international 1racking of U.S. exp ons. including precursor chemical s. USCS is also developing a dmabase 10 tabulate arres1 and seizure statistics for illegal exponation of precursor chemicals.
E0			    C. Successful Prosecutions .
E0			". Uni1cd Stales AUorncys around the nation continue 10 ackno""..lcdge methamphe tamine as a growing threat. Numerous methamphetrunine cases have been investiga1eJ and prosecuted by federa.1 agencies in close coordination and cooperation with 1he stmc and local law enforcement agencies. Many other s have been pro ecuted by local District Auorney·s Offices 1hroughout 1he country."
E0			 The OCDETF program, administered by DOJ. is an inter-agency )au· enforcement program which tar­ gets the highest- level drug traffickers in the country. including methamphctaminc lraffid ;ers. The nine federal agencies panicipa1in g in the OCDETf program ac1 in concen with numerous s1a1e and local agen­ cics and have achieved unprecedented lc\'els of coopcra1ion and coordination .
E0			 In addi1ion, in J 996 , the Direc1or of ONDCP designaled a five-state region in 1hc Midwest  as  a  High ln1ensi1y  Drug  Trafficking  Area  (HIDTA).  This   HIDTA  will  address  1he  problem   of  methamphetamine use. production. and trafficking  in  Nebraska .  Iowa,  Kansas.  Missouri.  and  Soulh  Dako1a  and  is  chaired  by the U.S. Anomey for lhe District of Nebraska.
E0			 Of the many successful federal methamphelamine prosecutions. a few arc summarized helou·:
E0			        ◦ Life Semence Imposed On Convicted Methamphetamine Trafficker. On April 24, 1997, in 1he Eastern Districl ofWashing1on, a federal coun imposed a life sentence  upon  Bernard  Montgomery  who  had been convicted of charges relating to his  melhamphe1amine  manufacturing  and distribu1ion  operations in Oregon and Albena, Canada. Co,defendants Lloyd Buxton and Edwin  Dale  McCain  received sentences of 30-year prison 1erms. The convic1ions culminaled a seven-month joint investigation involving the DEA, Royal  Canadian  Mounled  Police,  Hamey  Counly  (Oregon) Sheriff's  Office, Oregon Suue Police, and I.Assen County (Califorrtia) Narcotics Task Force. z z :u::i
E0			    • Life Sentence For Convicted Methamphetamine Trafficker. On December 17, 1996, in 1he Eas1em District of Missouri, Brian Dierling was sen1enced to life imprisonmenl wi1hou1 the possibilily of parole. A co-defendant, Arthur Holt, received a 420-months sentence, while 1wo other co-defendanlS, Mark Perkins and Lewis Younger. each were senlenced 10 almosl 20 years in prison for conspiring to distribute methamphetarrtine. This OCDETF inves1iga1ion was lhe join1 effon of the DEA , U.S . Marshals Service. Nonheas1 Missouri  Drug Task Forc, e  Quincy (Illinois)  Police Depanment,  Illinois State Police. Missouri Highway Patrol, Wcsl Central Ulinois Task Force, Adair Coun1y (Missouri) Sheriffs Department, Pu1nam Counly Sheriff's Dcpanment, Adams Coumy (Illinois) Sheriff's Depanment. Iowa Highway Patrol, Missouri Stale Fire Marshal's Evidence Bureau, and Schuyler County (Missouri) Sheriff's Depanmenl.
E0			    • Drug Transporters Indicted Following Largest Methamphetamine Sei:.ure in the U.S. On November 12. 1996, 11 defendants were indicted in the District of New Mexico, following lhe February 1995 seizure of almost 700  pounds of  metharnphctamine and  200  pounds of  marijuana. Two of 1he defend ants, Hcc1or Barron-Ramirez and Chicho, are charged as principal adrrtinistralors of :1 con1inuing criminal enterprise, the drug kingpin statute thal is resen ·ed for 1he highest echelon of par­ ticipants wi1hin a drug 1rafficking organiza tion. The methamphe1aminc and mariju::ma . which origi­ nated in Juarez. Mexico, had been  packed  in10  molded  fiberglass eonlaincrs  and  loaded  inlo the trail­ er a1 a warehouse in El Paso. and was being transponed 10 Chicago. This OCDETF invesligation was conducted by agenlS of the DEA and U.S. Cus1om. Service, as pan of the Southwesl Border lni1iali \'e.
E0			    • Chemical 5,iles Company Owner Sente11ced for lllicir Sule of Mcrhamphctami11e Precursor Chemicals. On September 17. 1996 . in 1he'Wcs1em Districl of Texas. Hec1or Dominguez was sen- 1enced 10 a signific::m1 term of imprisonment for possessing with intent 10 distribute '.!5 kilograms oi phenylacelic acid, a precursor chemical used in the produc1ion oi methamphetamine. Domingu z. an 011..ner of a small chemical sales comp:my in El Pas,o was arrested as he al!emptcd 10 sell 1he pheny­ lacelic acid 10 a DEA inform::ml.
E0			    • Largest Methti.mphetamine Trafficking Organization in Sou.rhea.sum New Mexico Taken Down. On July 17, 1996. in 1he Dis1ric1 of New Mexico, 26 individuals were charged in a 28-counl indicunem alleging a conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine and related fireanns charges, as well as forfeiture allegations against three pieces of land valued at more than $8,000,000. The principal administrator of this organization and several of his family members were engaged in operating a continuing criminal enterprise. The organization, centered in Roswell, New Mexico, was responsible for transporting 500 pounds of methamphetamine from California to New Mexico. This OCDETF investigation was conducted by law enforcement agents from DEA, FBI, U.S. Marshals Service, New Mexico State Police, Roswell Police Department. and Artesia Police Department.
E0			    D. Joint Task Force and Working Group Efforts.
E0			. In accordance with the Administration's goals of maintaining an open dialogue on methamphetamine concerns, several work..ing groups and task forces have been established to share information and db,cuss pending issues. Following a California-wide methamphetamine strategy meeting sponsored by DEA and BNE in May 1996 in Sacramento, California, a work..ing group of local. state, and federal investigato and prosecutors (Precursor Committee) was established to improve strategy against and prosecution of rogue precur.;or chemical supplier.;. The working group has already produced an investigation strategy which has been used as a guide around the state and in national training effons. In addition. Lhe group, work..ing with DEA and BNE Headquarters, has spearheaded a number of policy changes within the agencies to increase the likelihood of success in precursor prosecu1ions.
E0			. ln addition, the Precursor Comrniuee. chaired by the U.S. Attorney for 1he Southern Distric1 of California, and with lhe panicip.ition of Lhe other U.S. Anorney's Offices throughout California, has gener­ ated a target list of 1he largest precursor violators. Currently. there are a number of muhi-disui.ct investiga­ tions against these violacors who are located both within and oulside of California. The Committee meets regularly to coordinate investigations and share intelligence information with state and local entities.
E0			. In coordination with DEA Headquaners, the Precursor Committee has also begun a campaign to have legitimate chain drug and warehouse stores voluntarily restrict the availability of products that can be diverted to manufacture methamphetamine. Beginning in February 1997, Wal-Man. the nation·s largest retail chain. announced that it would voluntarily limit sales of pseudoephedrine, phenylpropanolamine and ephedrine.
E0			. As pan of the Precursor Committee. a California Prosecutors Working Group has been fanned. consist­ ing of Assistant U.S. Attorneys (AUSAs) from the four California districts and deputies from selected District Anorneys and the Attorney General's Office around the state. This group has already generated a number of reference guides co assist investigators. In addition. they arc jointly researching and addressing key legal issues which affect precursor prosecutions. so that a common approach to various proof and search and seizure issues may be taken throughout the state.
E0			" The U.S. Attorney's Offices throughout the OCDETF Sou1hwes1 Region have each designated an experienced AUSA to panicipate in a·methamphetamine working group. These melh.amphet:::trnine contacts conduct monthly 1eleconferenccs to share information regarding methamphetamine trends in tht! districts and to coordinate ongoing in\'estigations of rorue chemical companies. The Southwest Border metham­ phe1amine contacts group aho generated a re[!""ional reference guide to be di uibuted co investigaiors and prosecutor.; throughout the Southwest and is nov, coordinating  training sessions in the same reg io n.  Th.: San Diego County Methamphetamine Strike Force, composed of community leaders from 70 federal. state , and local agencies from law enforceme nt, health services, state couns. and drug treatment centers. has developed an action plan in the areas of interdiction, prevention, intervention, and treatment."
E0			 DOJ has worked to launch the Methamphetamine lnteragency Task Force, to ex.amine the best ways to reduce demand of methamphetamine, as required by the Act. Thb Task Force  will  bring together cxpem from all over the country to design. impleme nt. and evaluate the education. prevention. and treatment prac­ tices and strategies of the Federal government with respect to methamphetamine and other synthetic stimu­ lants.
E0			    E. Training. >::­ :<: cc ::; ::; u
E0			The Administration believes that the unique sensitivities surrounding the methamphetamine probkm W31Tant special training and awareness. In addition. DOJ's Advocacy Institute and Office of Legal Education have developed and offered a course on methamphetamine prosecutions . This course covered the operations of methamphetarnine laboratory. distribution patterns of methamphetaminc, search and seizure issues, precur.;or chemicals regulations. pro-active investigations, and prosccutive strategies. Training sessions continue to be arranged by  the  U.S. Attorneys  from  the Southern  District of California and the District of Nebraska to coordinate and share techniques and lessons learned with prosecutors in the Midwest districts .
E0			In addition . DEA has nearly doubled the number of clandestin.: laboratory ceniftcation training schools offered to state and local law enforcement from seven in FY 1996 to 13 in FY 1997 and established tv.·o remote training sites in San Diego and Kansas City. These schools will pro\'ide training  for 520 local oiii­ cers this year.
E0			Funhermore, DEA is reviewing the possibility of providing additional chemical hazards training for law enforcement agents. especially in  light  of the toxic and  incendiary  risks involv ed.  For  instance, in  March 19 97. a DEA Special Agent in Blackbum. Missouri inhaled some dangerous acidic fumes in a raid on a clandestine methamphet.amine laboratory. The agent suffered some minor bums to the nostril area and was taken to the hospital for treatment.
E0			"DEA also has funded a 24-hour mc1hamphc1aminc telephone number in il5 San Diego Field Division 10 provide law enforcement. treatment. and preven ti,·e services 10 San  Diego County at no cost.  DEA ha, joined forces with organizations - such as the Partnership for a Drug Free Ame rica and other cnu ues rep­ resenting prevent ion, law enforcement. treatment, and medical professional s - to pro vi de infom1ation and lectures on substance abuse to communities throughout the United States. DEA's Operation VELOCITY is producing a \'idemape production to educate law enforcement offic.:rs on som<"" oi the. chemical hazards oi clandestine laboratory investigations  .  Clandestine  lahoratory  awareness  posters ar.:  heing distributed  to stat and local clandestine laboratory enforcement teams throughout the United States."
E0			    IV. International Efforts.
E0			 Mexico-based organizations are now lhe predominant force behind mc1hamphel.lmine and precursor chemicals rr.afficlc.ing. The Adminisl.J'ation has been advising and training our foreign counlerparts - particu­ larly in Mexico - on ways to curb methamphctamine r.rafficlcing. as well  as  precursor chemical  smuggling and diversion. Funher, the Administration has  been augmenting  the  role  of  the existing  U.S.-Mexico work.ing group on precursor chemicals. which  oversees the training  of Mexican officials  and the  mechanics  of the exchange of chemical information with Mexico .
E0			 Indeed, we are seeing some modest successes in  Mexico. In  1996 ,  Mexican  law enforcement  authori­ ties seized more than a ton of  precursor chemicals - an  unprecedented  action .  The  Mexican  Government has also promulgated regulations restricting the number of  pons  through  which  precursor chemicals  may enter their country. The DEA's Office of Diversion Control has established an  automated  process for noti­ fying the relevant Mexican authority of each impending U.S. expon of selected chemicals to Mexico .
E0			 DEA has also provided substantial training to Mexican law enforcement authorities. In January  1997. DEA provided a thrce•day I.J'aining program in Mexico City to the Mexican government officials who arc responsible for chemical diversion in\'estigations. In  December  I 996, the  DEA  Mexico  City Country Office similarly a three•day seminar on the conl.J'OI of precursor and essential chemicals . These seminars included courses on chemical identification, safety equipment, and raid planning, among other topics .
E0			    V. Demand Reduction Efforts.
E0			    A. Educa..rion and Pre•ention.
E0			The Administration continues to stress the need for public awareness with respect to the methamphcta­ mine threat. All segments of our society - including law enforcement, teachers, judges. social workers . and public health officials - should learn about the hazards posed by this drug and should proclaim its dangers to America's youth.
E0			Two mcthamphetaminc conferences have been scheduled to assess progress and solicit input from the State s for revision of the National Methamphctamine Strategy. The first, a western regional conferen.:e. was held on January 12-13, 1997 in San Francisco, California . This Conference was co-hosted by Senator Feinstein and ONDCP, and 0\'er 160 persons participated from six states. The second Conference will take place on May 28-30, 1997 in Omaha. Nebraska and will be co•hosted by Senator Kcrrey and OJl:DCP.
E0			These Conferences bring together policy makers. researchers. public interest groups. law enforcement_ treatment . and pr.: \'ent ion specialists to share information, increase undemanding. and m.ike recommend3 - tions on improving the nation 's stracegic response to this growing problem . The Atto rney General. Director of ONDCP. DEA Administracor. Director of NIJ. and the Director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) will address the National Conference in Omaha . These Conferences build upon the Administration's efion lo educate the American public about the mechamphctaminc threat.
E0			CoUtction Of Data.
E0			 NIJ's DUF program has been so successful in gathering  imponant  drug  use data  and  information  that 1he Administration has decided to expand  the  program  more than  three  fold -  from  23 sites 10 75 sires - by fiscal year 2000. and i1 will be renamed Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM). ADAM will estab• lish a unique capacity lo collecl and  distribuie  reliable  data about ongoing  and emerging  drug use trends and crime patterns on a timely basis; it has received the s1rong suppon  from NIDA and  DEA.  ADAM  will be especially useful in developing effective national - as well as local - policies. and ii will institute an ou1reach program to gather additional  data from a targeted  population, ini1ia1e local coordinating councils to assist in the selection of outreach sites. and re•design data gathering methodology to reflect a broader population base and 10 better sample arrestee drug use and crime pauems .
E0			 The Administration's Operation Drug TEST is being implemented wi1h the Administrative Office of the United States Couns . Twenty.[ive federal dis1ricts have agreed to test arrestees for drug use - in most cases. prior to the arrestee·s li t appearance before a judicial officer. The Adminis1ra1ion hopes to expand thjs drug-testing. sanctions, and 1reatment program in an additional 25 districts in 1998.
E0			    B. Tuatmentfor Methamphetamine Abuse.
E0			Adminis1ration personnel are continuing 10 work with medical researchers and ueatmcnt practitioners to study whether there are  any  unique  behaviors of  methamphetamine abusers and special  measures that should be undenaken to restrain, but not funher injure, the user during arrest. Government officials have panicipated in public health conferences 10 determine the direction that medical  and scientific  research should take lo study the physical and chemical effects of methamphetamine, medical complications associ­ a1ed with its abuse. and 1Ieatmen1 and prevention methods.
E0			The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) held a conference in June 1996 10 study the sequelae of methamphe1amine abuse with implications for prevention , treatment. and research. The conforence included participants from the National Institutes of Heahh (l'-IH). DOJ. and ONDCP. a, well as a number of expens in lhe areas of research, treatment. and prevention.
E0			"NIDA held a conference entitled ""Methamphetamine:  Abuse , Treatment,  and  Preve ntion.""  on December 2·3. 1996 in San Francisco. This regional meeting brought together scientists. practitioners , and community leaders to discuss whal is known about merhamphet:unine abuse and addiction in the western United S tates and how to improve the response to this growing problem. The panicipanrs reviewed  the current state of epidemiology. basic research. prevention. consequences, and treatment. Additiona lly. KIDA continues to conduct research to dc,·elop specific treatment protocols, although research shov,.s that general psychosocia l and behavioral treatment effectively reduces drug use ."
E0			NIDA and other research has dramatically increased our knowledge ahout the neur.il basis ior psychus1imulam drugs (including melhamphetamine) and the neurotoxic psychostimulant methampheta• mine and related drugs. !\IDA currently suppons $20 million in research annually to understand the epi­ demiology of mcthamphetaminc use. its mechanism of action and effects ,10 brain iunctions. behavioral consequence s of mcthamphetarnine . anti ireatment anti prevention implications and approache s.
E0			With funding from SA.MHSA. a  group in somhern  California  has reponed 1hat  lhere is a measurable response of methamphetarnine users to psychosocial interventions, and  Lhat  the general  Lreatment  experience. as reflected by the auendance at therapeutic sessions. breaks in u-eatment panicipation, and total treatmcnl received, docs not differ significantly between methamphe1arnine and cocaine user...  A pilot  follow-up study  is in progress.
E0			Funhermore, SAMHSA  has a major proposals to investigate  the implications of  methamphetamine abuse.    It will evaluate the effects of methamphetamine on pregnancy and  post-natal development.  The  propo ed project will examine, retrospectively. the association of melha.mpheumine use during pregnancy  with the medical and developmental consequences found among two cohons of pre-natally metharnphetantine--exposed children born in 1989 and 1990.
E0			These effons are impon.ant because they will facilitate our understanding of how the behavior of methamphetarnine users may endanger themselves, others in the home or the immediate community, and Jaw enforcement  personnel.  Greater knowledge about  the characteristics of  melhampheumine users and  the ability to identify them is impon.ant because invesligative and prosecutive decisions may be affected if a defendant. .i witness. or an informant has a drug abuse problem.
E0			    VI. Successful Initial Data Regarding Administration's Efforts.
E0			 The Administration believes thal ilS vigorous effons have led to a moderation in the trend of methamphetamine Lrnffick.ing and abuse, based upon the same statistical criteria  previously  used.  The  preliminary  data from NIJ's 1996 Drug Use Forecasting figures show that in eight western cities (Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Omaha, Phoenix, Ponland, San Diego, and San Jose), methamphetamine use declined between 7 and 52.
E0			percent from 1995 figures. The only city that showed an increase in methamphe1amine use was San Antonio, which rose from 1.5 percent in 1995 to 2.1 percent  in  1996.  In the remaining  14 cities panicipating  m  the DUF program (Miami. Cleveland, New Orleans. Chicago. District of Columbia, Fl. Lauderdale, Detroit. 1anhattan. Birmingham, HouslOn. St. Loui . Indianapolis, Allanta, and Philadelphia). fewer than  I% of arres1ees 1es1ed positive for metha.mpetaminc. 1n keeping with trends of recent year . the 1996 DUF figures show tha1 adult femaJe arres1ees u  metharnphetamine mo  than male arrestees. and  white arres1ee!> coniin ucd to use ntcthamphetamine in greater percentages than African-American and Hispanic arrt!slees.
E0			National Institute of Justice Drug Use Forecasting 1995-1996 Comparison 1995 (%) 1996 (%) San Dieao 37.1 29.9 Phoenix 21.9 12.2 Portland, OR 18.7 12.4 San Jose 18.5 14.8 Omaha 8.1 4.3 LosAnneles 7.5 7.0 Denver 3.8 2.2 San Antonio 1.5 2.1
E0			 Nevertheless, our continued effons must remain vigilant and should be fonified. We must be cautious not to relax our vigorous efforts. because our goals and objectives have not yet been accomplished. We need to continue a comprehensive assaull against the dangers associao=d with methamphetamine produc­ tion. distribution, trafficking, and abuse.
E0			    VII. Increased Resources Requested.
E0			To demonstrate the Administration's continued effons to combat the methamphe1am.ine problem, it has requested additional resources be devoted to the threat.
E0			A significant portion of the methamphetamine trafficking is occurring along the Southwest border. As part of the Administration's Southwest Border Initiative (SWBI), many DOJ components received signifi­ cant resource enhancemems in fiscal year 1997. 'Ibe SWBI targets trafficking groups that manufacture and distribute methamphetamine as well as other drugs. In the Administration's fiscal year 1998 request, the U.S. Attorneys, DEA, and FBI are seeking a total of 3.59 positions (146 agenb and 41 attorneys) and S46.8 million as part of the SWBI.  Much of these resources will be used to assis1 in combatting the trafficking  of methamphetamine.
E0			The rise in methamphetamine trafficking has also caused an increased caseload for the U.S. Attorneys. and in response, the Administration's fiscal year 1998 request for U.S. Attorneys includes an enhancement of 56 positions (37 attorneys) and $5,161,000 for its Narcotic and Dangerous Drug program. In addition,  the Administration is seeking three additional DOJ Criminal Division attorney positions in fiscal year 1998 10 increase its ability to coordinate the SWBI from headquaners. These fX>Sitions will supfX)rt the Attorney General's goal to achieve enhanced centralized  management of the investigations and prosecutions related to the large-scale, multi-district methamphctamine ca-.cs. With respect lo DEA. the fiscal year 1998 budget rcques1 include:. an increase of7-i fX)Sitions t60 agents) and SI I. I million in resources IO fund a comprehensive approach to combat methamphetamine 1rafficking. The FBI is focusing on identifying the most significant Mexican manufactun:rs and distribu­ tors of methamphetamine and targeting 1hc command and control individuals of lhesc Or-£anizations. including key distribution networks in small and medium-sized U.S. cornmunilies. In addition, 1he FBI is focusing its resources on methamphetamine distribu1ion element!> located in problem areas, such a.s Omaha, Nebraska, St. Louis, Missouri, and Jackson, Tennessee.
E0			    VIII. Conclusion.
E0			 The Adminis1ration is dedicated to continuing its efforts to stop the spread of methamphetamine traf­ ficking and abuse in 1his country. Curbing the lide of methamphetamine from abroad. stemming its east­ ward march, and punishing those who traffic in this pernicious poison are all part of our effons. We are making a no1iceable difference, and methamphetamine usage is beginning to drop almosl everywhere in the country, as the Drug Use Forecasting numbers so vividly show.
E0			  While we are taking steps in the right direction, we cannol  become complacent.  We must remain strong  in our commitmenl to fight 1his  menace until  we have completely eliminated  it from sociely,  Life sen­ tences for major u-affickers are entirely appropriate. Companies which facilitate these crime!> must be pun­ ished as well.
E0			" We have begun to tum the tide on methamphetamine abuse and uafficking, and we must maintain our vigilance if we are to completely vanquish this threat. ""     • ""Idrugsumm.qa3 Page 1JI .,;.,.,u- 14, 'Eqwr"
T0			" MAYORS' SUMMIT ON DRUGS Questions and Answers May 21, 1997 ;   """"-""'Clb"
D0			Methamphetamine Report
D0			Q.  What does today's report say?
D0			A.      Today's report provides an update of the Administration's National Methamphetamine Strategy and make two key findings: (1) that methamphetamine use is down in 8 key cities; and (2) that clandestine lab seizures by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) are up 170% in 1996. The Justice Department  report  cites 1996 data  which shows that in eight western cities --Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Omaha, Phoenix, Portland, San Diego, and San Jose-- methamphetamine use declined between 7 and 52% from 1995 levels.
D0			Moreover, the report shows that our strategy is being aggres·sively implemented and showing results. We've worked with Congress to strengthen penalties for meth trafficking and established new controls over precursor chemicals used to manufacture meth. U.S. Attorneys -- working with coalitions of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies -- are successfully prosecuting methamphetamine, including lifetime sentences for certain convicted methamphetamine traffickers. Federal agencies are working to increase information about the dangers of meth. They're producing meth-specific education and prevention materials, hosting local conferences and training local law enforcement.
D0			Q.  What is methamphetamine? Why is it so dangerous?
D0			A.  Methamphetamine is a synthetic stimulant drug that creates extreme aggressiveness among chronic users. The violence-prone, irrational, and aggressive behavior associated with methamphetamine usage make it an especially volatile drug. Meth can be snorted, smoked, injected, or ingested orally. The effects of methamphetamine can last anywhere from 4 to 24 hours, while the effect of cocaine is measured in minutes. The crash that occurs with the tapering off of methamphetamine's effects is often potentially psychologically disastrous.
D0			Additionally, clandestine laboratories that manufacture methamphetamine pose an environmental and safety hazard, as toxic wastes are frequently dumped on the ground or into waterways, as well as the enormously high risk of a fire or explosion. Anyone near a meth manufacturing lab is in drugsumm.qa3    Page 2-j potential danger, and cleanup costs, per lab, run into thousands of dollars.
D0			Q.  How much does methamphetamine cost?
D0			"A. A gram of methamphetamine can begin at $50. For comparison purposes, a gram of cocaine costs about $100. For this reason, meth is often referred to as the ""poor man's cocaine."""
D0			Q.  How serious is the methamphetamine problem?
D0			A.      The methamphetamine problem is serious and spreading. In recent years, use of the drug has spread from the West to the Midwest. As a result, meth-related emergency room episodes doubled between 1991 and 1994, and the number of meth-related deaths tripled. Seizures of clandestine laboratories and along the Southwest border also increased during this time period.
D0			More importantly, methamphetamine is a triple killer and extremely dangerous: First, it is a cheap, highly addictive, long-lasting stimulant that often induces violent behavior; Second, labs used to manufacture meth present a high risk of fire or explosion, endangering nearby residents; and third, the toxic wastes produced by meth labs are often dumped on the ground and in waterways, posing an environmental threat to entire communities.
D0			Q.      Why are you only providing meth data for 9 cities? Is there data on other cities?
D0			A.      The Drug Use Forecasting System collects meth data for 23 cities across the country. The methamphetamine use amongst the arrestees tested in the other 14 cities was so low, it was determined to be insignificant. By insignificant, we mean less than one percent.
D0			Q.  Doesn't the drop in the numbers for methamphetamine mean that·we're just generating hysteria about methamphetamine when the problem is really disappearing?
D0			A.      Not at all. I am very encouraged by the new, lower numbers. But we are just turning the corner. Now is not the time to  let  up.  The numbers  show  that when we work hard,  we  can have  some effect. Now,  we've got to redouble that effort and help to prevent the  spread  of  this dangerous  drug to  the eastern part of the U.S.
D0			    Q. If illegal drugs are such a big problem, then why didn't your new anti-gang bill contain new drug provisions? Idrugsumm.qa3   Page 3)
D0			        A. Our juvenile crime bill does contain increased penalties for people who sell drugs to kids and use kids to sell drugs. But we should keep in mind that existing federal drug laws are already pretty tough. Trafficking can carry up to  a life sentence.    ·
D0			But we also need to do is to make sure that local prosecutors have more resources to go after the gangs that pedal drugs to our kids. Our juvenile crime  bill  does that, too. ·
T0			Additionally, our anti-gang strategy calls for expanding after school programs. This will not only help us cut crimes when kids would be otherwise unsupervised, it will help schools get the message out that gangs, guns and drugs are dangerous.
T0			Q.      Mr. President, despite the 1994 Crime Act and tough drug laws, federal statistics show enormous increases in drug use among teenagers. Don't these figures show that you have failed and that you are taking the wrong approach?
D0			A.      I am deeply disturbed by the current trends in teenage drug use. General McCaffrey, the Attorney General and I have spent a great deal of time on this issue. That's why I've proposed a national media campaign, leveraged with private sector resources, to reach the 68 million kids at risk in this country.
D0			That's also why we need more programs to stop crimes and drug use from happening in the first place. We need a place for young people to go in those hours after school when they are unsupervised. If we don't, they may just wind up on a street corner using drugs or getting involved in delinquent or criminal activity. I've asked Congress to provide funds for after-school programs and for programs for at -risk youths-- so we could keep kids off the streets and out of trouble. I was disappointed that the House didn't include these provisions in its juvenile crime bill, but I'm hopeful that we'li be successful in the Senate.
D0			Money Laundering
D0			Q:  Could you briefly describe the proposed regulations on money  laundering?
D0			A:  When I learned of the successes of the New York Geographic Targeting Order (GTO) in dramatically reducing the flow of narcotics proceeds to Columbia, I asked the Treasury Department to examine ways to extend the GTO nationally.     • c     drugsumm.qa3    Page 4]1
D0			"Today's regulations are a response to my request. There are three proposed rules which will be published today.  The most  fundamental  of  these proposals is to register ""money services businesses"" generally,  which includes money transmitters or remitter, money order issuers and sellers, travelers check issuers and sellers, retail currency exchanges, and check cashers."
D0			The second proposed regulation  would  extend  the  suspicious  activity reporting requirements  -  already  in  place  with respect to banks - to money transmitters and issuers, sellers and redeemers of traveler's checks or money orders.
D0			The final proposed regulation essentially makes the New York GTO apply nation-wide and on a permanent basis. Under the proposed rule, money transmitters would be required to report currency transactions of $750 or more that involve the transmission of funds to any person outside of the United States. The rule also requires the remitters to verify the identity of the person sending the funds.
D0			Q:  When will these proposed regulations become effective?
D0			A:      There will be a 90-day comment period that begins today. We will then review the comments and make any appropriate changes to the rules. Once that is complete, we will publish the final rule. We hope to  do this by January 1, 1998.
D0			Therules regarding suspicious activity reporting and the new $750 reporting threshold will take effect 30 days after the final rules are published. Money services businesses will have 180 days from publication of the final rules to register with FinCEN.
D0			Q:  What are the current reporting requirements for sending money transmissions outside the U.S.?
D0			A:  Currently, no record has to be kept for any transmission under $3,000. For transmissions of $3,000 or more, the money transmitter must keep a record of the transmission. For transmissions of $10,000 or more, the money transmitter must fill out a Currency Transaction Report or CTR and file it with the IRS.
D0			Q:  Why the $750 threshold?
D0			A:      Our experience with the El Dorado Task Force indicates that most legitimate money transmissions are between $250 and $500, and that most of the ,. ·:  ijdrugsumm.qa3  Page 5] abuse by money launderers occurs above this level. Thus, we made the threshold $750 so as to exclude the majority of legitimate businesses from reporting requirements.
D0			Q:  Money transmitters are used primarily by people who do not have bank accounts -the poor and immigrants. Isn't it then discriminatory to have a $750 threshold for transmitters and not banks?
D0			A:      We do not believe the proposed regulations are discriminatory. The $750 amount applies to wires purchased in cash that are sent anywhere outside the United States. We did not focus on any particular country or region.
D0			Also, these regulations do not prevent anyone from wiring money anywhere. You can pay cash to send $100,000 to Colombia tomorrow, so long as you fill out a form and provide a photo ID. The proposed rules are designed to stop the abuse of the money transmitter industry by criminals by collecting information, not to prevent legitimate transactions.
D0			Banks are already subject to extensive regulation. Today's proposed rules are intended to deal with a relatively unregulated area of the financial services industry -  the money services businesses.
D0			GENERAL DRUG POLICY QUESTIONS
D0			    a. Why do you think spending $175 million on an ad campaign will reduce drug use    among our youth?
D0			A.      The central challenge we face is to reverse the surge in youth drug rates-­ this is the focus of my 1997 National Drug Control Strategy and it is the primary concern of the mayors. My targeted anti-drug advertising campaign-­ which would involve about 1 percent of the federal counterdrug budget-­ holds the promise to change our youth's relaxed attitudes toward drugs. We have 68 million kids who are vulnerable to drugs. It is imperative ·that we get our kids accurate information about drugs.
D0			Q.      What do you think of the Sentencing Commission's recommendations on penalties for crack and powder cocaine?
D0			A.      Last month, I commended the Sentencing Commission for moving forward with recommendations to Congress to reduce the di_sparity between crack and powder cocaine penalties. My Administration will give them very serious consideration.  I have asked Attorney General Reno and General Mccaffrey to review the Sentencing Commission's recommendations and report back to me by the end of June.     • l[drugsumm.qa3    Page6]
D0			"However, I continue to believe that our sentencing laws must reflect that crack cocaine is a more harmful form of cocaine. The Sentencing Commission's new recommendations do so. Trafficking in crack, and the violence it fosters, has a devastating impact on communities across ""America, and any changes in penalties must ensure that more dangerous offenders receive tougher sentences."
D0			Q.      Isn't the National Action Plan put forward by the Mayors essentially a  criticism of your Administration's drug policy? Doesn't it call for more funds and different actions to be taken?
D0			"    A. I don't think so. On the contrary, I think the Mayors' Action Plan is complementary to our own National Drug Strategy. Both of our plans share the same number one priority: that drug use amongst our kids must be reduced. Both of our plans call for a comprehensive drug strategy that includes enforcement, treatment, prevention and education. And both of our plans recognize the importance of responding to the country's growing methamphetamine problem -- as well as cracking down on money laundering. While some of the details vary, are plans are largely similar. 05/19/97    12:07 .... ti-' --· ...... .,,-- ,· ,, """

D0			NATIONAL METHAMPHETAMINE STRATEGY UPDATE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
D0			In April 1996, the Administration released the National Methamphetamine Strategy, which assessed the threat and outlined an action plan for efforts to reduce the spread of methamphetamine.    Since that time, the Administration has significantly enhanced its efforts to combat methamphetamine abuse and trafficking. While some progress has been made, we need to maintain our vigilance in the effort.
D0			The Methamphetamine Problem:    Methamphetamine is a dangerous synthetic stimulant drug that can create extreme aggressiveness among chronic users; it is cheaper than cocaine and produces a longer high.  Use of the drug has historically been concentrated in the West and Southwest, but there are indications that its popularity is spreading to the Midwest and eastward.   The clandestine laboratories that manufacture methamphetamine pose an environmental risk and public safety hazard, as toxic wastes are frequently dumped on the ground or into waterways.
D0			Legislation:    Based upon the Administration's initiative and persistence, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996 last October.    The Act strengthens criminal penalties for methamphetamine trafficking and establishes new controls over precursor chemicals.
D0			"Law Enforcement:    The Administration has significantly stepped up its efforts in methamphetamine law enforcement, particularly with respect to the Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Task Force [""OCDETF""] efforts and the establishment of a Midwest High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area [""HIDTA""].  As of September 1996, all U.S. Attorneys have provided district plans assessing the current threat and ways to address it, and establishing coordination groups among community agencies and groups. Numerous methamphetamine cases have been successfully investigated and prosecuted by federal agencies, in close coordination with the state and local law enforcement agencies."
D0			Prevention and Education:   The Department of Education is conducting meetings to assess the need for a prevention and education strategy on methamphetamine and will send guidance to local schools to reduce methamphetamine use. A $10 million fund has been authorized from the Forfeiture Fund for methamphetamine reduction activities, and requests are currently being reviewed.
D0			Treatment:  As of today, there is no specific treatment protocol for methamphetamine; however, the Administration is funding the study of users' behavior patterns to formulate appropriate protocols.
D1			Data Collection:    The National Institute of Justice's Drug Use Forecasting Report is due to be released in May 1997, which will include substantial data on methamphetamine abuse.    The National Institutes of Health is also conducting an in-depth study of the methamphetamine user and will present its preliminary findings at a national conference.
D1			Conferences:    More than 400 people from all over the country and many diverse disciplines have participated (or will participate) in methamphetamine conferences to share information, increase understanding, and propose recommendations to improve the nation's response to the methamphetamine problem.
D1			Publications:       The Office of National Drug Control Policy published two documents in January 1997 on methamphetamine Pulse Check:  Methamphetamine Trends in Five Western States and Hawaii and Recent DAWN Data on Methamphetamine and Speed. The next edition will be released later this month.
D0			REPORT ON METHAMPHETAMINE ABUSE AND TRAFFICKING IN THE UNITED STATES:   An Update of the National Methamphetamine Strategy
D0			"    I. Introduction. The trafficking and abuse of methamphetamine -- a highly destructive, addictive and violence-causing synthetic drug -­ continues to be a national problem.  Methamphetamine, also known on the street as ""crank,,.. ""ice,"" and ""speed,"" is a dangerous synthetic stimulant that results in an addiction cycle and physiological trauma· similar to that associated with ""era.ck"" cocaine use.   Methamphetamine may be injected, smoked, snorted, or ingeste.d orally, making it increasingly attractive to casual users."
D0			        A. Historical Background.
D0			"Until the early 1990s, methamphetamine was largely associated with motorcycle gangs who supplied users in various parts of the United States.   Available data show that in the last few years, methamphetamine abuse has risen significantly in the West and Southwest portions of the country.    The Drug Use Forecasting [""DUF""] statistics (released in July 1996) confirmed that methamphetamine use was highest in western and southwestern locales. According to the Drug Abuse Warning Network [""DAWN""], between 1989 and 1995, the estimated number of nationwide emergency-room drug abuse episodes involving methamphetamine     • doubled, and between 1991 and 1994, the number of methamphetamine deaths nearly tripled."
D0			"The methamphetamine problem has been spreading into the Midwest and eastward into states such as Arkansas, Georgia, and Florida.    For example, in 1996, the Drug Enforcement Administration [""DEA""] seized 236 clandestine methamphetamine laboratories in Missouri."
D0			Well-organized poly-drug organizations with roots in the Mexican communities on both sides of the border have seized control of methamphetamine trafficking, using sophisticated chemical procurement, manufacturing and transportation techniques. The emergence of the Mexican drug trafficking organizations and their extensive involvement in methamphetamine production and distribution has re-defined the nature of the problem in the United States.   According to the El Paso Intelligence Center, the amount of methamphetamine seized along the southwest border increased dramatically in recent years -­ nearly 100-fold between 1992 and 1994.
D0			Unlike the cocaine business where Mexican traffickers are forced to rely upon their Colombian counterparts as primary suppliers, the Mexican organizations need n?t depend upon outside sources to manufacture methamphetamine. Once the precursor chemicals are obtained, Mexican organizations control all links of the entire production, transportation, and distribution chains -- and therefore, unfortunately, gain virtually all of the illicit profits. The Mexican organizations that dominate wholesale methamphetamine trafficking are capable of producing unprecedented quantities of high-purity methamphetamine in large­ scale laboratories.
D0			Methamphetamine also poses a unique public health and environmental hazard because of the nature of its manufacturing process.  The toxic properties associated with chemicals in and around methamphetamine laboratories introduce special health risks to law enforcement agents and the neighboring public; the incendiary and explosive nature of these chemicals further adds to the public safety risks.  These hazards and challenges warrant special precautions and training.
D0			        B. The Administration's Response.
D0			As a result of this growing methamphetamine threat, in February 1996, the Administration organized and coordinated a National Methamphetamine Conference in Arlington, Virginia to raise the public awareness of the increasing problem.    Over 200 representatives from federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies nationwide participated in the Conference, and for three days, experts shared their experiences, successes, and setbacks in their fight against methamphetamine.
D0			"In response to the methamphetamine threat, the President released the National Methamphetamine Strategy [the ""Strategy""] in April 1996. The Strategy assesses the methamphetamine threat, identifies the issues, and draws an action plan to avert the spread of methamphetamine, which, if unchecked, would become a national scourge."
D0			"The Strategy incorporates many of the recommendations from a broad spectrum of the law enforcement community.   It also recognizes that in order to tackle the methamphetamine and precursor chemicals problem, the Government must adopt a multi­ disciplinary approach, including legislation, law enforcement, training, chemical regulation, international cooperation, environmental protection, education, and treatment. Therefore, the Strategy called upon the collective wealth of experience and expertise of the Departments of Defense, Education, Health and Human Services, Justice, State, Treasury, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Office of National Drug Control Policy [""ONDCP""], and other noted experts and scholars."
D0			    II. The Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996.
D0			"Based upon the Administration's initiative and persistence, Congress took an important step when it enacted the Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996 [the ""Act""), which was signed into law on October 3, 1996.    The Act includes many elements that had been suggested in the National Methamphetamine Strategy, including increased penalties and regulatory provisions for precursor chemicals."
D1			"Specifically, the Act directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to increase penalties for trafficking in methamphetamine and its precursor chemicals to reflect the nature of such offenses, their relative harm to society, and the need for aggressive law enforcement action.   It also requests that the Commission consider significant penalty enhancements for laboratory operators who mishandle ignitable, corrosive, reactive, and toxic chemicals so as to pose a risk to public safety and the environment.    The Department of Justice [""DOJ""] is attempting to ensure that the Sentencing Commission's Guidelines, currently in the drafting phase, reflect the legislative intent to increase penalties substantially for methamphetamine offenses."
D1			The Act includes tighter controls on retail sales of drug products containing key precursor chemicals:  ephedrine, pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine.  Because methamphetamine must be synthesized from precursor chemicals, regulatory control of a select group of chemicals can impede clandestine production of the drug.
D0			    III. Methamphetamine:   A Top Law Enforcement Priority.
D1			The Administration continues to place methamphetamine enforcement efforts as a top priority.    We must continue our cooperative partnerships among federal, state, and local agencies and organizations.   There should be continued frank and candid conversations to discuss openly the difficulties faced by each region of the country.
D1			In 1996, at the request of the Attorney General, each U.S. Attorney assessed the methamphetamine problem in her/his district and together with the federal, state, and local agencies, came up with a plan to address the problem.  In some cases -- particularly, in the Midwest and California -- the U.S. Attorneys developed regional strategies.
D1			In addition, law enforcement agencies continue to develop intelligence and information on trafficking organizations and clandestine laboratories to assist in the monitoring of shipments of methamphetamine and its precursor chemicals -- with a special emphasis on major violent methamphetamine trafficking organizations. Based upon this information, federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies are selecting and pursuing the highest-level and most dangerous targets.
D1			 In addition, the Administration is addressing public safety issues connected with the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine. The environmental dangers presented by manufacturers of methamphetamine and the explosive potentialities pose significant hazards to private citizens and law enforcement personnel.
D0			 One sad example of the dangers of methamphetamine production occurred in Perris, California on April 19, 1997, when a fire exploded in a trailer home seriously burning two young children, ages 4 and 6. The investigators determined that the fire was caused by the mother of the two children attempting to extract pseudoephedrine from certain pharmaceutical tablets.  The mother was subsequently arrested on suspicion of manufacturing methamphetamine and four counts of child endangerment, and more than 1,400 bottles of pseudoephedrine were recovered from the scene. Such dangers must be addressed -- not only by law enforcement authorities -- but also in cooperation with public health and safety officials.
D1			        A. Drug Enforcement Administration Initiatives.
D1			 The DEA, in particular, has demonstrated its commitment to combat the spread of methamphetamine trafficking and abuse by undertaking significant law enforcement and educational efforts. DEA Clandestine Laboratory Enforcement Teams seized 879 clandestine methamphetamine laboratories -- 2.7 times the number seized (326) in 1995.    Current projections indicate that an even higher number of seizures will be achieved in 1997. [DEA map on lab seizures. 1 ]
D1			1   The above chart represents the laboratory seizures in which the DEA assisted or participated; it does not, however, account for the numerous law enforcement actions by the state and local authorities.    ·
D0			In addition, DEA's Special Operations Division, since April 1996, has funded or assisted in approximately 80 major methamphetamine investigations of Mexican targets.   Many of these investigations involve the use of extensive court-authorized electronic surveillance and other sophisticated investigative techniques.
D0			 DEA has also provided substantial support to state and local law enforcement agencies in combatting the distribution of methamphetamine on our streets.   The DEA Domestic.Operations Section established a Special Enforcement Program entitled Operation VELOCITY which targets major methamphetamine organizations, as well as independent traffickers in the United States.
D1			" Moreover, the DEA Office of Diversion Control established a priority targeting system named Operation BACKTRACK which targets rogue chemical companies that supply clandestine methamphetamine laboratories.   Also, DEA, in conjunction with the California Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement [""BNE""), the Western State Intelligence Network, and the El Paso Intelligence Center, continues to work to establish a National Clandestine Laboratory Data Base, which will assist all law enforcement agencies in methamphetamine investigations and provide a national perspective on clandestine laboratories, based upon input from all law enforcement agencies.    DEA has formulated plans to purchase new safety equipment, such as air monitors, air purified respirators, laboratory trucks, fire-resistant clothing, and other tactical clothing for DEA agents and state and local officers who raid clandestine laboratories."
D0			        B. Successful Prosecutions.
D0			. United States Attorneys around the nation continue to acknowledge methamphetamine as a growing threat.   Numerous
D0			". There are two primary factors which contribute to the large increase in DEA seizures of methamphetamine laboratories --     (1) the spread eastward of clandestine laboratory activity; and     (2) the enhanced attention by law enforcement around the country. The spread eastward of methamphetamine manufacturers can.be attributed, in large part,·to the growth of small entrepreneurs using the ""Nazi"" method"" to produce small batches of methamphetamine (four ounces or less).   Their source of precursor chemicals frequently is pseudoephedrine tablets purchased at local retail outlets; approximately 680 tablets of pseudoephedrine yield one ounce of finished methamphetamine. methamphetamine cases have been investigated and prosecuted by federal agencies in close coordination and cooperation with the state and local law enforcement agencies, and many others have been prosecuted by local District Attorney's Offices throughout the country."
D0			. Indeed, in 1996, a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area was designated by the Administration for a five-state region in the Midwest. This HIDTA will address the problem of methamphetamine use, production, and trafficking in Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and South Dakota.
D0			. Of the many successful federal methamphetamine prosecutions, a few are summarized below:
D0			Life Sentence Imposed On Convicted Methamphetamine Trafficker.  On April 24, 1997, in the Eastern District of Washington, a federal court, for the first, imposed a life sentence upon a defendant convicted of charges relating to his methamphetamine manufacturing and distribution operations in Burns, Oregon and Alberta, Canada. Co-defendants received sentences of 30-year prison terms.       The convictions culminated a seven-month joint investigation involving the DEA, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Harney County [Oregon] Sheriffs Office, Oregon State Police, and Lassen County [California] Narcotics Task Force.
D0			Methamphetamine Trafficker Convicted.   On April 4, 1997, in the Southern District of Texas, a defendant was convicted on four counts charging various methamphetamine offenses, including possession with intent to distribute 136 grams of methamphetamine and his attempt to possess more than BOO grams of 98% pure methamphetamine.
D0			Drug Transporters Indicted Following Largest Methamphetamine Seizure in the U.S.    On November 12, 1996, 11 defendants were indicted in the District of New Mexico, following the February 1995 seizure of almost 700 pounds of methamphetamine and 200 pounds of marijuana.   Two of the defendants are charged as principal administrators of a continuing criminal enterprise, the drug kingpin statute that is reserved for the highest echelon of participants within a drug trafficking organization.    The methamphetamine and marijuana, which originated in Juarez, Mexico, had been packed into molded fiberglass containers and loaded into the trailer at a warehouse in El Paso, and was being transported to Chicago.   This OCDETF investigation was conducted by agents of the DEA and U.S. Customs Service, as part of the Southwest Border Initiative.
D0			        ◦ Chemical Sales Company Owner Sentenced for Illicit Sale of Methamphetamine Precursor Chemicals.   On September 17, 1996, in the Western District of Texas, a defendant was sentenced to a significant term of imprisonment for possessing with intent to distribute 25 kilograms of phenylacetic acid, a precursor chemical used in the production of methamphetamine.  The defendant, an owner of a small chemical sales company in El Paso, was arrested as he attempted to sell the phenylacetic acid to a DEA informant.
D0			"        ◦ Largest Methamphetamine Trafficking Organization in Southeastern New Mexico Taken Down.   On July 17, 1996, in the District of New Mexico, 26 individuals were charged in a 28-count indictment alleging a conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine and related firearms charges, as well as forfeiture allegations against three pieces of land valued at more than $8,000,000.   The principal administrator of this organization and several of his family members were engaged in operating a continuing criminal enterprise. The organization, centered in Roswell, New Mexico, was responsible for transporting 500 pounds of methamphetamine from California to New Mexico. This OCDETF investigation was conducted by law enforcement agents from DEA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation [""FBI""], U.S. Marshals Service, New Mexico State Police, Roswell Police Department, and Artesia Police Department."
D0			        C. Joint Task Force and Working Group Efforts.
D1			 In accordance with the Administration's goals of maintaining an open dialogue on methamphetamine concerns, several working groups and task forces have been established to share information and discuss pending issues.    Following a methamphetamine·strategy meeting sponsored by DEA and BNE in May 1996 in Sacramento, California, two working groups were established to address improvements in investigative approaches to methamphetamine cases and prepare a model for successful investigation and prosecution of rogue chemical company targets.
D1			" The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of California has formed a precursor chemicals working group [the ""Precursor Committee""), primarily involving the districts that form the new OCDETF Southwest Region, in close coordination with the DOJ Criminal Division and the DEA Diversion Division. Among its goals is to develop a priority list of targeted chemical corporations that are suspected of trafficking in precursor chemicals.   The Precursor Committee has also prepared an Investigative Techniques and Prosecution Tactics Outline Regarding Rogue Chemical Companies and facilitated intelligence sharing among agencies and prosecutors."
D1			" The second group, the California Prosecutors Working Group, consists of Assistant U.S. Attorneys [""AUSAs"") from the four judicial districts in California and Deputy District Attorneys from selected California District Attorney's Offices.   The Working Group is addressing the following:  (1) discovery and ethical issues associated with methamphetamine laboratory cases in which hidden transponder devices are utilized; (2) responses to common defenses utilized in methamphetamine and precursor chemical cases; and (3) successful use of sentencing enhancements in state and federal prosecutions."
D1			 The Southwest Border Methamphetamine Contacts Group, consisting of AUSAs from each of the relevant districts, will facilitate coordination of inter-district investigations of rogue chemical companies.    The San Diego County Methamphetamine Strike Force, composed of community leaders from 70 federal, state, and local agencies from law enforcement, health services, state courts, and drug treatment centers, has developed an action plan in the areas of interdiction, prevention, intervention, and treatment.
D0			        D. Education and Training.
D1			. The Administration believes that the unique sensitivities surrounding the methamphetamine problem warrant special training and awareness.  In addition, DOJ's Advocacy Institute and Office of Legal Education have developed and offered a course on methamphetamine prosecutions.    This course covered the operations of methamphetamine laboratory, distribution patterns of methamphetamine, search and seizure issues, precursor chemicals regulations, pro-active investigations, and prosecutive strategies.  Training sessions continue to be coordinated by the U.S. Attorneys from the Southern District of California and the District of Nebraska to share techniques and lessons learned with prosecutors in the Midwest districts.
D1			 In addition, DEA has nearly doubled the number of clandestine laboratory certification training schools offered to state and local law enforcement from seven in FY 1996 to 13 in FY 1997 and established two remote training sites in San Diego and Kansas City.   These schools will provide training for 520 local officers this year.
D1			 Furthermore, DEA is reviewing the possibility of additional chemical hazards training for law enforcement agents, especially in light of the toxic and flammability risks involved. For instance, in March 1997, a DEA Special Agent in Blackburn, Missouri inhaled some dangerous acidic fumes in a raid on a clandestine methamphetamine laboratory; the agent suffered some minor burns to the nostril area and was taken to the hospital for treatment.
D1			 DEA has funded a 24-hour methamphetamine hotline in its San Diego Field Division to provide law enforcement, treatment, and preventive services to San Diego County at no cost. DEA has also joined forces with organizations -- such as the Partnership for a Drug Free America and other entities representing prevention, law enforcement, treatment, and medical professionals -- to provide information and lectures on substance abuse to communities throughout the United States.   DEA's Operation VELOCITY is producing a videotape production to educate law enforcement officers on some of the chemical hazards of clandestine laboratory investigations.  Clandestine laboratory awar.eness posters are being distributed to state and local clandestine laboratory enforcement teams throughout the United States.
D1			 Two Methamphetamine Conferences have been scheduled to assess progress and solicit input from the States for revision of the National Methamphetamine Strategy. The first, a western regional conference, was held on January 12-13, 1997 in San Francisco, California. This Conference was co-hosted by Senator Feinstein, and over 160 persons participated from six states; it was well-received.    The second Conference will take place on May 28-30, 1997 in Omaha, Nebraska and will be co-hosted by Senator Kerrey.
D1			" These Conferences bring together policy makers, researchers, public interest groups, law enforcement, treatment, and prevention specialists to share information, increase understanding, and make recommendations on improving the nation's strategic response to this growing problem.    The Attorney General, Director of the National Institute of Justice [""NIJ""], and the Director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse [""NIDA""] will address this National Conference."
D0			    IV. International Efforts.
D1			Mexico-based organizations are now predominant in methamphetamine and precursor chemicals trafficking.  The Administration has been advising and training our foreign counterparts -- particularly in Mexico -- and on ways to curb methamphetamine trafficking.    They have been encouraged to implement meaningful controls to prevent smuggling and diversion of precursor chemicals.   Further, the Administration has been augmenting the role of the existing U.S.-Mexico working group on precursor chemicals, which oversees the training of Mexican officials and the mechanics of the exchange of chemical information with Mexico.
D0			    V. Demand Reduction Efforts.
D0			        A. Education and Prevention.
D1			 The Administration continues to stress the need for public awareness with respect to the methamphetamine threat.    All segments of our society -- including law enforcement, teachers, judges, social workers, and public health officials -- should learn about the hazards posed by this drug and should proclaim its dangers to America's youth.
D1			 DOJ has worked to launch the Methamphetamine Interagency Task Force, to examine the best ways to reduce demand of methamphetamine, as required by the Act.  This Task Force which will bring together experts from all over the country to design, implement, and evaluate the education, prevention, and treatment practices and strategies of the Federal government with respect to methamphetamine and other synthetic stimulants.
D0			        B. Collection Of Dat .
D1			"The NIJ is also expanding its DUF program from 23 to over 40 sites in 1997, and the program will be renamed the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring [""ADAM""].    This program is important in tracking the spread of an emerging drug like methamphetamine and will  · provide timely data about drug trends from a select population. The next DUF Report on methamphetamine use is due to be released in May 1997."
D1			The Administration's Operation DRUGTEST .is being implemented with the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. Twenty-five federal districts have agreed to test arrestees for drug use -- in most cases, prior to the arrestee's first appearance before a judicial officer.  The Administration hopes to expand this drug testing, sanctions, and treatment program to an additional 25 districts in 1998.
D0			        C. Treatment Protocol for Methamphetamine Abuse.
D0			As of today, there is no specific treatment protocol for methamphetamine.   Because chronic methamphetamine users frequently suffer major changes in neural chemical activity and brain functions, treatment periods for methamphetamine users can be much longer and more extensive than treatments for other abused drugs.
D1			 Administration personnel are continuing to work with medical researchers and treatment practitioners to understand the behaviors that threaten law enforcement and the measures that will be taken to restrain and not further injure the user. Government authorities have participated in public health conferences to determine the direction that medical and scientific research should take with respect to physical and chemical effects of methamphetamine, medical complications associated with its abuse, and treatment and prevention methods.
D1			 In addition, NIJ has begun to formulate a demonstration plan that would test drug treatment protocols for methamphetamine­ involved persons in the criminal justice systems.    Drawing upon the expertise of drug treatment professionals, NIJ hopes to support the development of effective methamphetamine treatment technologies as the criminal justice system confronts the continuing challenges of drugs and crime.
D0			NIDA held a research conference in June 1996 to study treatment.    NIDA research has dramatically increased our knowledge about the neural basis for psycho-stimulant drugs like methamphetamine and the neuro-toxic potential of these stimulants.        Methamphetamine has been shown to be a powerfully addictive stimulant causing physical and behavioral changes. NIDA currently supports $20 million in research to understand the epidemiology of methamphetamine use, its mechanism of action and effects on brain functions, behavioral consequences of methamphetamine, and treatment and prevention implications and approaches.
D0			"NIDA is also supporting research entitled ""Integrating Treatments for Methamphetamine Abuse:    A Psychosocial Perspective.""    Their findings suggest that there is a measurable degree of response by methamphetamine abusers to psychosocial· intervention and that the general treatment experience, as reflected by the attendance of therapeutic sessions, breaks in treatment participation, and total treatment received does not differ significantly between methamphetamine and cocaine users."
D1			"The National Institutes of Health [""NIH""] similarly are conducting an in-depth study of the methamphetamine user and will present its preliminary findings at a national conference.    NIH also plans to expand its drug testing program to improve data collection."
D1			"Furthermore, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [""SAMHSA""] has two major proposals to investigate the implications of methamphetamine abuse. The first proposal will evaluate the effects of methamphetamine on pregnancy and post-natal development; this type of information is currently obtained anecdotally.    The proposed project will examine retrospectively the association of methamphetamine use during pregnancy with the medical and developmental consequences found among two cohorts of pre-natally methamphetamine-exposed children born in 1989 and 1990.        SAMHSA's second project will study the effects on suppressing methamphetamine demand at the community level with intensified drug-testing in the criminal justice system and at the workplace, combined with media campaigns and enhanced treatment for methamphetamine dependence."
D1			These efforts are important because they will facilitate our understanding of how the behavior of methamphetamine users may endanger herself/himself, others in the home or the immediate community, and law enforcement personnel. Greater knowledge about the characteristics of methamphetamine users and the ability to identify them is important because investigative and prosecutive decisions may be. affected if a defendant, a witness, or an informant has a drug abuse problem.
D0			    VI. Successes of Administration's Efforts.
D1			The Administration believes that its vigorous efforts have led to a moderation in the trend of methamphetamine trafficking and abuse, based upon the same statistical criteria previously used. Initial reports from available statistical data indicate that methamphetamine use have shown a slight decline.  [ONDCP will provide recent DUF and DAWN figures which presumably show that methamphetamine use has decreased in all cities, except San Antonio. These figures are due out in May.).
D1			Therefore, our continued efforts must remain vigilant and should be fortified.  We must be cautious not to relax such efforts, because our goals and objectives are not yet accomplished.   We need to continue a comprehensive assault against the dangers associated with methamphetamine production, distribution, trafficking, and abuse.
D1			    VII. Increased Resources Requested.
D1			To demonstrate the Administration's continued efforts to combat the methamphetamine problem, it has requested significant additional resources be devoted to the threat.    A significant portion of the methamphetamine trafficking is occurring along the Southwest border.
D1			"As part of the Administration's Southwest Border Initiative [""SWBI""), many DOJ components received significant resource enhancements in FY 1997.    The SWBI targets trafficking groups that manufacture and distribute methamphetamine as well as other drugs. In FY 1998 request, the U.S. Attorneys, DEA, and FBI are requesting a total of 359 positions [146 agents and 41 attorneys) and $46.8 million as part of the SWBI.   A significant portion of these resources have helped and will continue to assist in combatting the trafficking of methamphetamine."
D1			The rise in methamphetamine trafficking has also caused an increased caseload for the U.S. Attorneys, and in response, the Administration's FY 1998 request for U.S. Attorneys includes an enhancement of 56 positions (37 attorneys) and $5,161,000 for its Narcotic and Dangerous Drug program.   In addition, the Administration is seeking three additional DOJ Criminal Division attorney positions in FY 1998 to increase its ability to coordinate and support the SWBI from headquarters.   These positions will support the Attorney General's goal to achieve enhanced centralized management of the investigations and prosecutions related to the large-scale, multi-district methamphetamine cases.
D1			With respect to DEA, the FY 1998 budget request includes an increase of 74 positions (60 agents) and $11.1 million in resources to fund a comprehensive approach to combat methamphetamine trafficking. The FBI is focusing on identifying the most significant Mexican manufacturers and distributors of methamphetamine and targeting the key command and control elements of these organizations, including key distribution networks in small- and medium-sized U.S. communities.,  In addition, the FBI focuses its resources on methamphetamine distribution elements located in problem areas, such as Omaha, St. Louis, and Jackson.
D0			    VIII. Conclusion.
D1			"The Administration is dedicated to continuing its efforts to stop the spread of methamphetamine trafficking and abuse in this country.  The Administration will continue its cooperative efforts with the U.S. Conference of Mayors [""USCM"") in contributing to their ""National Action Plan To Control Drugs."" One of their top priorities has been to increase public awareness of the methamphetamine threat, and the USCM fully supports the Administration's initiative to combat the spread of methamphetamine.    Federal authorities will continue to investigate and prosecute cases aggressively, as well as promulgate strong regulations, provide training to state and local agencies, promote public awareness of the problem, and educate and treat methamphetamine users."
