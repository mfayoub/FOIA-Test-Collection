D0//			HHS may want to raise the bucket as part of the technicals discussion Ron wants to have. Here's the story: for many months, HHS could only see their way clear to a partial fix of the bucket. Just as we were about to give up on this, Clay Shaw wrote a letter saying congressional intent was a 100% fix of the bucket. This caused HHS to go back to the drawing board (for months). They now see a way to do a 100% fix, but their legal theory conflicts with OMB counsel's theory, and for the moment it's stuck there.
D1//			So HHS wants to throw into the technical mix the possibility that Congress could clarify this issue, and they may raise it at our conference call tomorrow. OMB doesn’t disagree. | don't see any downside, other than if we have to use a chit for it. But Haskins is on our side here, so it may not use a chit.
D1//			This morning | said we'd no longer need the bucket if the budget agreement becomes law. Not exactly so. Even with the budget agreement, some legal immigrants -- the elderly non-disabled -- who were in the U.S. before the welfare law was enacted will not get Medicaid coverage. States who wish to cover them without vastly expanding their Medicaid programs could do so if the bucket were enacted.
D1//			Ken is saying we can't do the bucket by 4/1, because CBO is reestimating the baseline in early/mid April and we don’t want it out before then. We are pressing him on his logic, since the cost of the bucket is already in the budget as a legislative proposal.
D1//			Can we do by April 1?
D0//			"This e-mail 1) notifies you that the Health Division communicated your guidance to HCFA on the three Medicaid “welfare reform"" issues and 2) outlines HCFA's response to your guidance."
D1//			1) SSI One-Month Gap -- We communicated to HCFA that the one-month gap policy should be made administratively through an All States Letter to the Medicaid Directors as well. HCFA will send over the All States Letter for OMB clearance later this week.
D1//			2) Medically-Needy -- We communicated to HCFA that the medically needy policy should be made administratively through an All States Letter to the Medicaid Directors as opposed to promulgating a regulation. HCFA said that they would discuss this option with their Office of General Counsel and notify us if they had any legal concerns. If not, HCFA will send over the All States Letter for OMB clearance. HCFA mentioned that they would like to distribute one All States Letter that would include both the medically needy policy and the delay regulation.
D1//			3) Delay Regulation -- We communicated to HCFA that you approved of announcing HCFA's intention to promulgate this regulation, since the NPRM process could delay the impact of qualified aliens losing SSI. HCFA wants to send out on All States Letter to the Medicaid Directors announcing this policy and to advise that States could retain Medicaid coverage for SSI recipients in the meantime.
D1//			First, we will schedule a meeting early next week with HCFA, OIRA, and the Health Division to discuss this regulation. Second, HCFA will send over the All States Letter for OMB clearance. This letter will include both the medically needy policy and the announcement of HCFA's intention to promulgate the delay regulation.
D1//			We also noted to HCFA that these policies should be handled administratively with little publicity. HCFA agreed. To ensure a consolidated process, OMB policy officials need to coordinate with other EXOP officials in order to convey that these policies should be handled with minimal publicity.
D1//			Latest status: We, especially OMB, are considering whether to do HHS's administrative fix to the bucket. It is not the advocates’ full fix, but a 2-part regulatory fix HHS devised: a temporary delay for everyone, which will help all states with a bucket problem; and a new policy on how states define “medically needy” Medicaid programs, which will permanently help some states with a bucket problem. Between the 2 parts, it will fix a decent portion of the bucket, but not all. (I will try to get a sense of how much.)
D1//			Nancy-Ann's first take is that Raines needs to decide whether HCFA must come up with an offset to the $1.9 billion cost. Ken and | have pointed out that we fixed a lot of the bucket in our welfare legistative fix package, in our proposal to exempt the disabled from SSI/Medicaid cuts. So theoretically we have already paid for a lot of this, and we're just transferring it from a legislative fix to an administrative fix. OMB is trying to scope out the overlap and numbers as they write a memo to Raines.
D1//			lam assuming we would agree with HHS's approach. | think we exhausted the advocates’ approach. And it will do good things for people and it's fully or largely paid for. | should note that it could take a bit of the steam out of our legal immigrant fix package, since the most compelling cases of legal immigrants in nursing homes would then be temporarily addressed. 1 think the only exception to that would be in states that affirmatively decide not to extend Medicaid to legals, and i'm not sure there are any such states at this time.
D1//			Option of total administrative fix off the table, unless COLO)sees something new.
D1//			- Budget's welfare legislative fix package includes partial fix for the bucket: exempt disabled legal immigrants from SSI cuts. This leaves out the elderly.
D1//			"- HHS's best admin fix thinking had 2 parts: -across the board 1 year delay; and -""medically needy” reg that will help some states."
D1//			Neither of these last 2 are in the budget so, if we want to go ahead with them, we can't talk about them Till the budget's beén out for a while. But we could theoretically tell the groups whe the budge is released that we continue to ponder the question of admin fixes.
D1//			The OMB director has apparently at last opined on the “bucket” issue -- i.e., whether there is an administrative way to allow more people losing SSI to keep Medicaid.
D1//			"Raines endorsed HHS's partial fix, which we've also been pushing. (HHS rejected on legal grounds the advocates’ argument that we could do a total fix, where no one would lose Medicaid as a result of losing SSI.) This partial fix would create a temporary ""bucket"" for everyone losing SSI (for a year, | think). And it would beef up what is included in a “medically needy” program in a way that would help a group of states."
D1//			The effect of this will be to convert part of our fix package from legislative to administrative. It also means health providers will be less interested in our package.
D1//			OMB doesn't think we should announce anything in the next week or two, because CBO is doing some baseline reestimate.
D1//			While we have never been certain that this confusing issue could be packaged into some kind of | announcement or event, OMB would apparently oppose making a big deal about this publicly. They are nervous that we'll be criticized. Not sure this makes sense.
D1//			This shou ROT pe announced or alluded to in our legal immigration briefing tomorrow.
T0//			There will be a staff level discussion within a few days on whether we should have an Administration bill on Superfund. Superfund reauthorization remains a priority for the majority in the Congress, and we will need to decide the Administration strategy soon. CEQ is contemplating calling a principal's meeting early next week.
D0//			This note is to ask your engagement on the process and to quickly summarize the options for strategy and my recommendation.
D0//			With regard to the process, | believe that any principal's meeting on this should be jointly convened mol by CEQ and NEC. @ economic issues are some of the driving issues here. A jointly convened : Séting W sénd an important message of balance on this issue. | plan to make this argument at the staff level. | suggest that you mention this to Gene Sperling.
D1//			The strategy options are three:
D1//			A) Prepare Administration principles, but allow agency assistance to both majority and minority staff to improve/prepare their bills. (There is a republican bill, there is as yet no dem alternative.) [It would need to be absolutely clear that assistance does not guarantee Administration endorsement. EPA is likely to support this view.
D1//			B) Prepare a narrow Administration bill. This approach would send three key signals: (1) we are serious about reform, (2) all Departments will have a voice, and (3) we will only support moderate changes. CEQ is leaning slightly towards this view.
D1//			C) Prepare a broad Administration bill. This approach would likely provide the most comfort to DOE and DOD because they will see this as a potentially disciplining process for the other Agencies. DOJ (Lois Schiffer) would vehemently oppose this approach.
D1//			| recommend that we initially support option A. In my view, the key supporting reasons are: 1) An Administration process to come up with a bill will be extremely contentious and will distract from our effectiveness on the Hill. 2) If we genuinely want a bill we will need to negotiate with the majority and there is no particular advantage to having spent months coming up with our own bill fist. 3) Principles that set a high standard, will provide guidance to negotiations and will provide thetorical cover to strengthen our hand in the negotiations.
D1//			The key weaknesses in this approach are: 1) Some departments will be unhappy enough to undertake their own discreet Hill efforts. | discount this concern because no matter what we do, departments will let their views be known to the Hill. While this adds a measure of chaos, which will likely create some interagency friction, | don't believe it is particularly damaging to the Administration as a whole. 2) We need to get key minority Representatives on board first, some of whom definitely do not want a bill to pass. 3) Environmentalists are likely to end up more critical of a bill that passes. 4) The Administration could be accused of not exercising leadership on this issue. My response would be that our leadership is in Brownfields and in the Administrative reforms.
D0//			Please let me know if you have concerns about my recommended approach.

D0//			Please let me know if you have concerns about my recommended approach.
D0//			As the President said in his State of the Union address, we can be proud that after decades of finger-pointing and failure, we are now replacing welfare checks with paychecks. Welfare caseloads have fallen another 2.4 million in the first 13 months of the new welfare reform law, a decline of 4.3 million, or 30 percent, since President Clinton took office. The President’s 1999 budget will build on this success, providing several targeted new tools to help even more people move from welfare to work, while restoring certain food stamp cuts which had nothing to do with welfare reform.
D0//			Welfare to Work Housing Vouchers. The President's FY99 budget will take further steps to promote work and welfare reform through a new $283 million plan to provide 50,000 new housing vouchers to welfare recipients who need housing assistance in order to get or keep ajob. Families could use these housing vouchers to move closer to a new job, to reduce a long commute, or to secure more stable housing to eliminate emergencies that keep them from getting to work every day on time. These vouchers, awarded to communities on a competitive basis, will give people on welfare a new tool to make the transition to a job and succeed in the work place. ‘
D0//			Welfare to Work Transportation. One of the biggest barriers facing people who move from welfare to work -- in cities and in rural areas -- is finding transportation to get to jobs, training programs, and child care centers. Few welfare recipients own cars. Existing mass transit does not provide adequate links to many suburban jobs at all, or within a reasonable commute time. In addition, many entry level jobs require evening or weekend hours that are poorly served by existing transit routes. To help welfare recipients and other low income workers get to where the jobs are, President Clinton has proposed a $100 million a year welfare to work transportation plan as part of his ISTEA reauthorization bill. This competitive grant program would assist states and localities in developing flexible transportation alternatives, such as van services.
D0//			Tax Credits for Employers. The President’s budget proposal extends two important tax credits for employers for an additional year. The Welfare to Work Tax Credit, enacted in the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, provides a credit equal to 35 percent of the first $10,000 in wages in the first year of employment, and 50 percent of the first $10,000 in wages in the second year, to encourage the hiring and retention of long term welfare recipients. The budget also extends the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which provides a credit of up to $2,400 for the first year of wages for eight groups of job seekers.
D0//			Food Stamps for Legal Immigrants: The President believes that legal immigrants should have the same opportunity, and bear the same responsibility, as other members of society. To that end, the President’s 1999 budget proposes to restore Food Stamp benefits for vulnerable groups of legal immigrants. The President’s proposals would provide Food Stamp benefits to 730,000 legal immigrants in 1999 at,a cost of $2.5 billion over 5 years. Specifically, benefits would be restored for: all families with ‘children; immigrants with disabilities and elderly immigrants age 65 and older who entered the U.S. before welfare reform was enacted, on the same basis as the SSI and Medicaid restorations in the 1997 Balanced Budget Act; refugees and asylees, whose eligibility would be extended from 5 to 7 years; Hmong immigrants who came to the U.S. after the Vietnam war; and certain Native Americans living along the Canadian and Mexican borders.
D0//			* Immigrant benefit restorations Consistent with the agreement, restore $9.7 billion in benefits for all legal immigrants who are or become disabled after 8/22/96
D0//			Food Stamps * Invest $1.5 billion to restore benefits and create 350,000 work slots for 18-50s; include performance standards and target all funds to 18-50s
D0//			Welfare to Work * Invest $3 billion, with a significant share provided directly to cities with large poverty populations
D0//			Ways and Means: Restores benefits for current beneficiaries, including the elderly, but not for new applicants (those who were in the country prior to 8/22/96 and became disabled after that date)
D0//			Agriculture: Spends $1.5 billion to create about 190,000 work slots; does not include performance standards and has lower requirement than in Administration policy to target funds to 18-50s
D0//			Ways and Means: Invests $3 billion split 50/50 between formula and competitive grants, with an acceptable share of funds to urban areas through JTPA system (PICs)
D0//			Education and Workforce: invests $3 billion split 95/5 between formula and competitive grants, with somewhat smaller share to cities; funds flow through JTPA system
D0//			Finance: Similar to Ways and Means, but restores benefits for new applicants who become disabled prior to August 1997 (date is in flux).
D0//			Agriculture: Spends $1.5 billion to create 250,000 slots; includes acceptable performance standards but only 75% of funds are targeted to 18-50s (vs. 100% in Administration policy)
D0//			” Finance: Invests $3 billion split 75/25 between formula and competitive grants; funds flow through TANF instead of mayors, which the Administration opposes
D0//			Minimum Wage Supports minimum wage for welfare recipients in workfare
D0//			Student loans . Opposes House and Senate proposal
D0//			* Privatization Opposes any privatization of determination of eligibility functions
D0//			SS] Maintenance of Effort (MOE) Opposes repeal of MOE requirement
D0//			Ways and Means\Education and Workforce: Denies minimum wage by allowing States to either reduce hours of work requirements or by counting Medicaid/child care/housing/etc. as income for calculating minimum wage
D0//			Education and Workforce: Establishes separate entitlement to pay the administrative costs of guaranty agencies; currently, annual funding is determined by the Sec'y of Education
D0//			Commerce: Allows all States to privatize Medicaid eligibility determinations
D0//			Agriculture: Allows all States to privatize Food Stamps eligibility determinations
D0//			Ways and Means: Repeals MOE requirement
D0//			Finance: Not in the draft mark; may be introduced during markup
D0//			Labor/Human Resources: Same as House
D0//			Finance: Allows ten States to privatize eligibility functions for all health and human services programs (including Medicaid, Food Stamps, WIC); approves TX waiver
D0//			Finance: / Does not repeal MOE requirement
D0//			We continue to work on clarifying the intent of the Family Violence Option and making it a useful tool for the states to help families escape violence and poverty in a meaningful way. As you may know, a Sense of Congress on Family Violence Option Clarifying Amendment is included in the House Budget Resolution working its way through Congress. This amendment delineates the intent of Congress when passing the Family Violence Option as part of last year’s welfare bill. Although the Budget Resolution is not a binding piece of legislation, it shows bipartisan support for the FVO in the broadest sense, and we believe it should be sufficient to instruct the Administration in its regulatory process and in its communications to the states.
D0//			In addition to the language in the Budget Resolution, Senators Wellstone (D-MN) and Murray (D-WA) have introduced 8. 671, and Representative Roybal-Allard (D-CA) stands poised to introduce similar legislation in the House. If the clarification set forth in the Budget Resolution is insufficient to promote proper interpretation by HHS as it promulgates regulations, we are asking for the Administration’s support for this bill which will clarify Congressional intent about the Family Violence Option and give states clear guidance as they implement their welfare plans.
D0//			In light of the additional research and data about the occurrence of violence in the lives of welfare families, we believe it is essential that the states have all the guidance and support that they need to address this problem and craft workable solutions. Currently, many states are hesitant to elect the FVO for fear of economic sanctions. Ifthe imprecise wording of the Family Violence Option in last year’s welfare bill is the stumbling block to a lucid interpretation of this option, then the answer is this Congressional technical clarification. It is imperative that this Administration, with its reputation as a friend to battered women, step forward and support this clarification. We hope that you will look favorably upon our request for your support of S. 671 and use the powers of your office to secure this endorsement.
D0//			Many of you already have some or all of the enclosed materials, but we wanted to make sure they were in your hands as the discussions between Administration officials, Congress, the states and advocates continue. Enclosures include:

The bill is only a technical clarification, but it could encourage more states to take the FVO.

D0//			Peter D. Hart Research Associates has just completed a national voter survey that includes two questions measuring support for extending minimum wage and other workplace legal protections to welfare recipients in workfare programs. The survey was conducted by telephone June 6 through 9 among a representative sample of 800 registered voters who participated in the 1996 elections. The margin of error on these results is +/-4%.
D0//			Strong voter support for minimum wage coverage. The survey results reveal that American voters strongly believe that minimum wage laws and other basic legal workplace protections should apply to those in state workfare programs. The survey question reads as follows:
D0//			AS you May know, Congress passed a law last year requiring able bodied welfare recipients to work in state workfare programs. Do you believe that the people who are required to work in these workfare programs should be covered by basic legal protections. including the minimum wage law, or do you believe that the states should not have to pay the minimum wage to welfare recipients in workfare pragrams?
D0//			Fully 69% agree that workfare participants should be covered, while just 25% believe that states should not have to pay participants the minimum wage.
D0//			We would note that workfare participants are clearly identified in this question wording (fwice) as still being “welfare recipients.” making the strong favorable response that much more impressive (and meaningful). The breadth of support for minimum wage coverage is also striking, including two-thirds of those with incomes over $50,000 (67%), professionals (67%), and white voters (67%). Even college-educated men 71%) and Republican voters (62%) favor minimum wage coverage by large margins.
D0//			Wage impact argument for coverage is strong. Voters’ initial suppor for coverage doubtless arises from a fundamental sense of faimess. Since other workers receive this protection, they reason, why shouldn't workfare participants in similar jobs? However, organized labor has another, less immediately obvious reason for believing that coverage is needed — namely, the corrosive effect that sub-minimum-wage workfare programs could have on the jobs and wages of low-wage workers outside of workiare programs. The survey tested the appeal of this argument for coverage against a powerful opposition case that focuses on the cost of coverage to taxpayers, and finds the wage impact argument prevails by a decisive two to one margin.
D0//			Supporters of paying the minimurn wage to people in warkfare programs say that many employees who currently work at the minimum wage would lose their jobs if workfare participants could be forced to work for less, and also say that exernpting one group of workers from minimum wage protections opens the door to undermining the minimum wage for others. (59% agree.)
D0//			Opponents of paying the minimum wage to people in workfare programs say that the taxpayers would have to support higher welfare budgets if states are forced to pay the minimum wage, and also say that welfare recipients who want better pay should get off welfare and find a job on their own. (21% agree.)

D0//			Diana got a somewhat mysterious call from Ann Lewis’ office last night inviting us to a meeting which | attended today. It turned out to be a small meeting (Ann, Eli Attie, Jen Palmieri) on the Welfare to Work Partnership proposal for a one-year anniversary event.
D1//			They like the idea Eli pitched in his memo to the President to have him go to a city with a significant number of companies pledging to hire welfare recipients. However, they expect the President to be on vacation and unavailable on August 22nd. Moreover, in order to frame the one year anniversary stories for the press, Ann thinks it's best to do an event 7-10 days before the anniversary anyway. Scheduling recommends either August 14 or 15th and Eli has recommended the following cities: St. Louis, Indianapolis, Columbus, and Baltimore. (Second tier choices would be Portland, Denver, Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Atlanta). At first glance, Ann thought St. Louis would be the best.
D1//			tye do the Eli event on the 14th or 15th, perhaps we release a one-year report on the bill at the hite House on the 22nd, as you suggested Bruce. I'll start looking into options ASAP.
D1//			| used the opportunity to pitch our other ideas as well. Ann suggested that Tuesday would be the best day next week to release the letter from the President to Congress on child support, since it's a down day with no other message currently scheduled. It's likely that timing will coincide well with the juvenile justice mark up. I'll] work with DOJ, Treasury, and HHS to coordinate.
D1//			There was also a Jot of support for having the President announce the new.caseload numbers (which should show we're down 3 million since Jan..'93) which hopefully will be ready around the, first week in July and perhaps combine it with theGhild care reg lf we don't use that for an immunization event. There are a couple of non-message event days before he goes to Spain (July 3, 4) where he could make a brief statement on the new numbers or at the top of another event July 2. Should we push for a Radio Address? (Since the President will be in Madrid that week, we're likely to be bumped by NSC.) If the numbers aren't ready by the 4th, we could them until he gets back on the July 21st and do something then.
D1//			There was less interest in the DLC conference. DLC had proposed holding a welfare to work conference either in D.C. sometime before Aug. 22nd or in Philadelphia during the National Conference of State Legislators gathering Aug. 6-10th. Communications/scheduling preferred the idea of having the President speak to the NCSL conference by satellite because the travel budget is too tight for him to attend, and because they thought it accomplished more than the DLC conference could. Scheduling has regretted the NCSL request already, but Intergovernmental and Scheduling are supportive of revisiting it as a satellite. DLC still wants the President to lead a roundtable discussion on welfare to work, which | think he would enjoy, so they proposed to Christa perhaps having that panel here at the White House and satellite the President's opening remarks to Philadelphia. What do‘you think? We could develop this idea further for the weekly to get some direction from POTUS.
D1//			Thus, this schedule could look something like: June 24th - child support release July 2-4th - release new caseload numbers Aug 6-7th - welfare to work roundtable - DLC and/or NCSL Aug. 14-15th - Welfare to Work Partnership event in city with companies Aug. 22nd - release some kind of report on the actual anniversary

Amid all the wrangling, some of the” ml authors of the federal legislation fear its Message of ending unlimited aid and shifting to a work-based system-may be getting muddled. “That's cruel,” Says Rep. Clay - Shaw ‘(R., Fla.), who is chairman of the - House welfare subcommittee. “The clock _ -is ticking, and this thing isn’t going to go away.”
D0//			It is ticking for local welfare adminis: trators as well as for recipients. In New York and California, falling caseloads and earlier welfare-to-work Innovations may ‘fase the task of meeting the initial requirement that 25% of a state's caseload participate’ in work activities, But that Tequire ment escalates to a daunting 50% of . the caseload by the-year 2002.
D0//			"“It's:frightening,” says Mr. Mecca of the California association of county welfare administrators.-""‘The longer it takes policy makers to decide what they want, the shorter the.time bureaucrats-have .to retool, redesign... .and’ turn. 60 years. of Social policy on itshead.”"
D0//			Let me say, finally, that there are a few other things that | think we have to do beyond these three issues of finishing the work of the budget, investing in our people, and expanding trade. This moment of prosperity and stability has given us an opportunity to work together to repair our social fabric, to join together to face those issues which, if we don't face them, could flare into crises and keep us from becoming the nation we ought to be in the new century.
D0//			And tet me just mention a few. You were kind enough to mention the Summit of Service that President Bush, President Carter, Mrs. Reagan, and General Powell and | and others sponsored in Philadelphia. One of the things we have to do if we want to give our children a better future is to help their parents be gainfully employed. We were able to reduce the welfare roils dramatically because of a growing economy and because of work we did with states before the passage of the welfare reform bill to help them move people from welfare to work.
D0//			Now, this welfare reform bill did two things. It required people on welfare who are able-bodied to move from welfare to work within a certain amount of time, and it gave the states in a block grant funds that used to be spent in a federal entitlement so that they would have more flexibility to create incentives for people to move from welfare to work.
D0//			Forty of our states now have a windfall there because they're getting money based on how much they got when the welfare rolls were at their peak, and there has been a 20 percent-plus drop in the welfare rolls in the last three years.
D0//			| urge you, in all the states that you're working in, to get the governors, to get the legi ith the business community to spend that money in ways that, with your efforts, can move a million more people from welfare to work in the next four years. We moved a million people in the last four when we were creating 12 million jobs -- that had never been done before, the 12 million jobs. Neither had the million people.
D0//			Under the terms of this welfare reform law, whether we create 12 million jobs or not in the private sector, we have to move nearly another million people. We have got to have your help, But the states have the power to do things like give employers the welfare check for a year or two to use as an employment and training subsidy for people that are especially hard to place; to spend even more money on child care; to spend money on education and training.
D0//			So | implore you to help us do this. It will be a terrible thing if, having called for welfare reform and personal * responsibility, the end of it is to wind up hurting poor people. That was never what was intended. The children should not suffer in this. And you are going to have to take the lead in helping to do this.
D0//			The second thing I'd like to say is, we have to -- now having faced the structural budget deficit in the country -- we have to deal with the generational deficit. That means we have to have long-term entitlement reform to face the realities of the baby boom generation retiring. And t will be -- as soon as we get the budget out of the way, I'll be working with the bipartisan leadership in Congress on an approach to that, and | ask for your support.
D0//			It also means that we have to fulfill the mission of the Philadelphia summit, with the public and the private sectors doing their jobs. Remember what the Philadelphia Summit was about: every child ought to have a safe place to grow up, decent health care, a good education and marketable skills, a mentor and the chance to serve.
D0//			And we live in a country where 11 percent of the prople over 65 are poor, but 20 percent-plus of the people under 18 are. And we cannot do well unless we do better by our children. So this inter-generational thing is about entitlement reform, but it's also abéutgiving ourkidsabetterchance.
D0//			The third issue -- the one I'm going to speak about in San Diego in a couple of days -- and that is the challenge presented to us as we become the world's first truly multi-racial democracy. We have five school districts in America today with kids from over 100 different racial and ethnic groups -- five. We'll soon have 12.
D0//			We have -- we all know this, but my Baptist minister from Arkansas came up to see me during the Inaugural and he told me he had a cousin who had a Baptist church across the river here in Virginia that now has a Korean mission and runs English as a second language classes out of the church. There are thousands of stories like this.
D0//			And yet we know that there are still dramatically different perceptions among different racial and ethnic groups, starting with the historic tensions that have existed between African Americans and whites in the country and layered on by the successive waves of immigrants that pose great challenges to us.
D0//			REQUEST: Welfare to Work Conference hosted by the DLC’s Progressive Policy Institute and the Welfare to Work Foundation.
D0//			PURPOSE: To demonstrate the President’s commitment to moving people from welfare to work, and to urge states to move forward in creating effective “Welfare to Work” programs.
D1//			BACKGROUND: Although nearly all states have submitted plans for how they will move people from welfare to work under the new welfare law, most of the plans are “placeholders.” So far there is very little evidence that states have engaged private and non-private sectors to create a bridge from welfare to work that will fully meet the challenges of the new welfare law. The President’s participation would call attention to model welfare to work programs and provide a road map to help welfare reform succeed.
D0//			PREVIOUS PARTICIPATION: | The President held a Welfare to Work event on May 20th in the East Room with companies pledging to hire from the welfare rolls.
D0//			DATE & TIME: 2 hours. July or early August. : *It is important that this conference take place before the one year anniversary of the signing of the welfare bill on August 22.
D0//			LOCATION: Washington, DC
D0//			PARTICIPANTS: _ State and local elected officials, employers, welfare to work program representatives, welfare experts and researchers, etc.
D0//			OUTLINE OF EVENTS: The President could moderate the first of three roundtable discussions which is on the topic of welfare to work.
D0//			REMARKS REQUIRED: Yes.
D0//			MEDIA COVERAGE: Yes.
D0//			As promised, here is the proposal for the welfare to work conference with President Clinton. We have incorporated comments trom you. We hope that it can be scheduled for July or carly August, before the one year anniversary of the bill-signing. We can begin working on a site for the event, and contacting speakers, as soon as the President's schedulers finalize a date.
D1//			"Sponsors: Progressive Policy Institute, The Welfare to Work Foundation, and a conservative think lank (possibly American Enterprise Instilute or the Progress Freedom Foundation). Strategic Objective: Refocus the debale [rom the Washington argument over whether the welfare bill should have been signed, to the crilical decisions being made right now by slates thal will delermine whether we create an employment system for welfare recipients. This is a significant moment for slates and others engaged in developing new policy that should focus on welfare-lo-work initialives. Although 47 slates have submitted slate plans under the new welfare law, most of the plans are ""placeholders"". Yet, this is the moment when states should be focused on ercating the new system that moves people from weltare to work. While the economy is strong, and states have new resources tor investment, states should be creating the system of intermediaries and other supports that have been proven to help people get and keep jobs. States will either focus on creating the employment system now, or be derailed in the effort by bureaucratic inertia. So far, there is very little evidenee that states have focused on ereating an employment system by cngaging the private and non-profit sectors, and changing the culture of the public sector. ‘Thus, there is a compelling need for Presidential leadership to refocus states and influential thought-leaders on the public policy needed to ereate the bridge to work."
D1//			"Premise: Finishing the job of ercating an employment system out of the old welfare programs requires three steps. lirst, we need to ereate the labor market bridge tor entry level workers -- a public/private system of readiness training. placement, and retention serviees. lor some workers, unsubsidized employment will not be an option al first -- for these participants a communily service opportunity will be necessary to meet the ""work-first"" requirements. Second, we must make work pay by ercating a scamless employment system tor all low wage workers (not just current and former welfare recipients): child care, health care ete. Minally, we need to measure our progress with the right standards: success means inercased independence through work, and deercased poverty. We must be able to identity the successful program components so they can be replicated and through monitoring, we can adjust the programs when necessary."

D0//			Presidential participation in the launch of PSA campaign oe by Education Excellence Partnership (comprised of the Business Roundtable, NGA, AFT, NAB and U.S. Department of Education) and Major League Baseball. The Partnership has requested that the President participate in an event at Camden Yards in order to facilitate the participation of Major League Baseball players who will be playing that day.
D0//			To launch a new series of public service ads featuring major league baseball players, that encourage students to work hard in school in order — to reach high standards, and encourage parents to be involved in their children’s schools. These ads would be the next phase in a series of PSA’s sponsored. by the Education Excellence Partnership (EEP), led by the national Business Roundtablé, and including the National Governors’ Association, the American Federation of Teachers and the U.S. Department of Education.
D0//			The Education Excellence Partnership (EEP) is a coaltion of key education, business and governmental organizations that work together to educate the public about the neeed to raise academic standards. The main vehicle for its work has been a public service campaign featuring TV and radio. spots that attempt to build support for increased academic standards, and fulfillment materials that provide greater detail and _ additional information about ways to get involved in local school reforms . As part of its effort to strengthen this ad campaign, the EEP, led by the national Business Roundtable, has formed a new partnership with Major League Baseball. The new PSA’s will feature baseball players in their role as parents. The fulfillment materials for this ad campaign will include examples of academic standards, including those that form the basis for the President’s national testing initiative.
D0//			The President has been invited to participate in an event on July 2, 15, or 17. These dates were selected to coincide with Baltimore Orioles home games as well as the schedules of other likely participants from the Business Roundtable. If none of these dates were available on the President’s schedule, it may be possible to negotiate other dates.
D0//			Camden Yards, because the organizers believe that major league baseball players will be most likely to participate in an event on a game day if it is held at the ballpark. They would be willing to explore holding the event at the White House if it were more convenient for the the President.
D0//			The Educational Excellence Partnership, which includes the Business Roundtable and the U.S. Department of Education, invites you to participate in the announcement this summer of our new parmership with Major League Baseball, at which time we will also be launching our new public service advertising campaign supporting higher standards in education.. These new ads depicting popular baseball players in their role as parents of school children will laud education and urge parents to become involved in their children’s schools. This campaign will be a win-win for all involved and should help build public support for education standards as well as Major League Baseball.
D0//			‘We intend to unveil our partnership and campaign in an appropriate event at Camden Yards in Baltimore on July 2nd, which is the day of an afternoon game, or July 15th or 17th, which are evening games. It would obviously be extraordinarily beneficial for all of our efforts if you could attend, Our event would likely be in late afternoon or early evening; once we have identified all our participants we will jointly develop an appropriate agenda.
D0//			Working singly and together the members of the EEP have made enormous strides in standards-based education reform since the initiation of our current efforts in 1989, duc in no small part to your efforts while governor of Arkansas and the momentum established by your administration. . Yet a great deal remains to be accomplished. We hope this partnership with Major League Baseball will {pews doubly effective, creating role models for parental involvement through the use of the icons of baseball. We can raise the visibility of our campaign that much higher through your participation. I hope you will give serious consideration to attending. ,
D0//			To highlight the Administration’s commitment to making communities - safer and promoting home ownership by providing incentives to law enforcement officers to live in low-income neighborhoods.
D0//			The Officer Next Door initiative will give a 40% discount to public safety personnel who purchase HUD-owned homes in designated areas. HUD has approximately 3,000 homes that it will make available for purchase as part of this one year program. This program will aim to prevent crime by increasing the presence of public safety personnel and giving police a greater stake in the community they are serving.
D0//			At this event, the President would call on mayors across the country to participate in the new HUD program. Los Angeles Mayor Riordan in partnership with Fannie Mae and Los Angeles Housing Department launched a similar program in March entitled “Homes for Peace Officers and Firefighters.”
D0//			As promised, here is the proposat for the welfare to work conference with President Clinton. We have incorporated comments from you.

D0//			Concluding remarks: Finishing the Job  Wrap-up by Will Marshall, and others. Call on the corporate leaders and state decision-makers to ensure that we build the bridge to work.
D0//			Welfare to Work Jobs Challenge. 0.6 1.0 1.0. 0.4 2 The Jobs Challenge is designed to help States and cities move a million of the hardest-to-emplo welfare recipients into lasting jobs by the year 2000. It provides $3 billion in mandatory funding for job placement and job creation. States and cities can use these funds to provide subsidies and other incentives to private business. The Federal Government also will encourage States and cities to use voucher-like arrangements to empower individuals with the tools and choices to help them get & keep We - bud yer napoleon jobs.
D0//			Enhance WOTC for Welfare Recipients. 0.0 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.0 0.3 For employers, the budget proposes tax incentives to create new job opportunities for long-term welfare recipients. The budget would create a much-enhanced credit that focuses on those who most need help -- long-term welfare recipients. The new credit would let employers claim a 50% credit on the first $10,000 a year of wages for up to two years, for workers they hire who were long-term welfare 0.3 recipients.
D0//			Extend WOTC for 18-50's. The budget also expands the existing WOTC tax credit by including able-bodied childless adults who, under the Administration's Food Stamp proposal, would face a more rigorous work requirement in order to continue receiving Food Stamps.
D0//			Subtotal, Welfare to Work* 0.7 1.1 1.2 0.5 0.1 3.6 *Totals may not add due to rounding.
D0//			Benefits for Disabled Immigrants. SSI Costs 1.6 1.7 1.9 1.8 2.0 8.9 Medicaid Costs 0.6 0.8 0.9 1.1 41.3 47 Total 2.2 2.4 2.9 2.9 3.3 13.7 The Administration's budget would restore SSI benefits for 310,000 legal immigrants who become disabled after their entry into the U.S., in recognition of the fact that they cannot provide for their own support through work. Of those 310,000 legal immigrant adults, approximately 190,000 would have Medicaid coverage restored. Barring legal immigrants who played by the rules from these safety net programs is unfair and shortsighted.
D0//			Benefits for Immigrant Children. 0.1 0.7 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.4 The welfare reform law denies SSI and Medicaid to many legal immigrant children who become seriously ill, or have an accident and become disabled, and whose families fall on hard times. Under the Administration's proposal, legal immigrant children would continue to be eligible for SSI and Medicaid. In FY 1998, this proposal would protect SSI and Medicaid eligibility for about 8,000 disabled immigrant children, and ensure medical care for about another 30,000 non-disabled children.
D0//			Extention for Refugees and Asylees. 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.6 The welfare bill exempted refugees and asylees from the benefit restrictions for their first five years in the country. The budget would lengthen the exemption for refugees and asylees from 5 to 7 years to provide  a more appropriate time for refugees and asylees to become citizens. It would protect eligibility for about 17,000 refugees and asylees in FY 1998.
D0//			"18-50's Work Requirement. 0.7 0.6 0.4 0.3 0.2 2.2 The Administration's proposal reconfigures the ""3 in 36"" time limit in the welfare statute in 4 key ways: (1) It changes the time limit to 6 months in 12; (2) Provides additional funds of $280 million total in FYs 97-02 to enable States to create work for people willing to work; (3) Imposes tough sanctions while protecting those who are willing to work; and (4) Provides States with more authority to provide Food Stamps as wages."
D0//			Shelter Deduction. 0.1 0.0 0.1 0.0 0.4 0.6 The Administration's proposal would accelerate planned increases in the excess shelter deduction and would eventually eliminate the cap on the deduction in FY02, allowing low-income families with high housing costs to deduct the full cost of their housing expenses when calculating their net income. 80% of the benefit of this proposal is to households with children.
D0//			Reindex the Standard Deduction. 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.1 0.1 The standard deduction is a general deduction given to all households. The welfare bill froze it, no longer allowing it to index. The Administration's proposal would reindex it to ensure that benefits keep pace with inflation.
D0//			Vehicle Asset Limit. 0.0 0.0 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.2 The welfare bill froze the Food Stamps vehicle asset limit (the maximum value of a car a household may own) which had previously been indexed. The Administration's proposal would increase and reindex the Vehicle Asset Limit, which has virtually been at the same level since 1977 even though the CPI for used cars has risen 125%.
D0//			Medical Coverage for Low-Income Disabled Children 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.3 The Administration's budget would allow disabled children who lose their SSI eligibility due to changes in the definition of childhood disability to retain their Medicaid health coverage.

D1//			Funds in 1999-2002 to help long-term recipients in high unemployment/high poverty areas go to work and keep jobs. Funds would be available only if majority of states did not meet work participation rates in prior year. Funds would be added to TANF, earmarked for work.
D1//			Enhanced tax credit for firms that hire long term welfare recipients--fund would pay firm’s share of FICA taxes for individuals hired and retained.
D1//			Funds for vouchers for training, job creation, and job placement to help long-term recipients in high unemployment/high poverty areas go to work and keep jobs. Funds would be added to TANF, earmarked for vouchers for individuals.

D1//			c) $1.4 billion through 2002 for working poor families that CBO says is needed to ] 2 keep them from getting short-changed by welfare reform (Dodd-Daschle). (This ' week, CBO is redoing its analysis of the shortfall -- dollar amount would change accordingly.)
D1//			d) Tax credit to companies for costs of building, renovating and/or operating child care centers (50% credit for eligible activities up to $150,000 per year per business). Cost: $2.6 billion (Kohl). (Because this proposal would subsidize already operating centers, Mark Mazur is developing an option that would subsidize only the expansion or creation of new centers, which would cost less.)
D1//			e) Loan forgiveness tax credit in President’s budget which could be used for individuals becoming child care workers. Cost: minimal.
D1//			BACKGROUND: Prime Minister Blair has tracked the Administration’s welfare reform efforts with great interest and has incorporated the themes of work, personal responsibility, and private sector involvement into his Welfare to Work strategies. A visit to an innovative welfare reform site would demonstrate first-hand what the public and private sector, working together, can do to help welfare recipients get and keep good jobs. The President could visit a business where the President and Prime Minister could talk with an employer, former welfare recipients, and the public officials involved in welfare reform in that community.
D1//			Giant Foods, Inc. has an excellent program in Prince George’s County, MD that would be ideal for this visit. They could tour a Giant grocery store, or possibly the central bakery facility. They could visit welfare recipients who are presently being trained or have completed training for positions such as bakery clerks, meat processors, cashiers, and pharmacy clerks.
D0//			To date, Giant has hired 71 of 91 people interviewed (exceeding the normal hire rate of 1 in 4). In the four months since the program began, only 5 people have left (compared to Giant's typical attrition rate of 50%). As soon as people enter Giant's training, they earn $6.60-$8.75 per hour (depending on the position) and receive full medical benefits within 30 days.
D1//			The company: Giant is based in Landover, MD and has 170 stores and 27,000 employees in the Washington Metro area. The company is partially owned by a British firm, J. Sainsbury PLC, the leading food retailer in the UK. Their training program is a partnership between Giant, the Private Industry Council, and the local welfare office in Prince George's County. We understand that the UFCW union supports the program, but will get more details. Governor Glendening's office is excited about the program and about the potential visit.
D1//			POTUS has never visited or met with Giant training program executives. Last welfare to work event was in November in Wichita.
D1//			- The President and the Prime Minister could tour the facility. - The President would then make formal remarks to be followed by a roundtable discussion or meeting with former welfare recipients, Giant Executives, and local elected officials who the Prime Minister could ask questions to.
D1//			I think we would want to show the Prime Minister how we are reforming welfare in America, i.e., how the public and private sectors are working together to move welfare recipients, who _are_ here primarily single women, to work. | do not think we would want to focus a visit on young men just because that’s what they're considering in Britain, but we would rather want to focus on the how-to-connect-welfare-recipients-to-jobs issue that seems to also be a strong interest of theirs.
D0//			Just had a lengthy and enlightening conversation with Cecilia Calvo at W2W Partnership. She is a weaith of information about what's going on in U.K. re: welfare reform, having recently led a group of high level British officials on a tour to NY, Washington, St Louis and Milwaukee and spending several weeks in Britain learning about what they are doing. She says that the most immediate focus is a 'New Deal’ for 18-24 year olds, starting in 12 pilot sites in January and going national in April. The program targets unemployed youth who will be called in once they have received assistance for 6 months. They will come into a job center, meet with a 'New Deal' advisor, get andassessment, and if determined job ready, go to work. If not, they will go through 12 weeks officialsStrive-like job readiness, including assessment for substance abuse and learning disabilities, then goingto one of four steps: unsubsidized job, long-term training, voluntary sector sort of like workingexperience), or work in the environmental! sector. This is largely andmalespopulation, not single parents. :
D1//			Given this focus, we may want to reconsider some of the site visit options, or at least ask people in the four states if they have suggestions for programs focusing on a similar population. Cecilia is sending me some info about some Americorps/welfare reform partnerships in Florida and NY. She said her visit to YouthBuild in St Louis was also good. At the same time, she says Blair et al remain very interested in how to operate effective job centers and private sector involvement. Se®Ms to me the quéStion is to what extent we want to highlight the youth issue, since the population the Brits are targeting is not really a primary focus of our welfare reform initiatives. Do you have any thoughts on this?
D1//			| concur, and will continue getting more details on_o| Lndians Indiana etaits on options in Indiana (Indianapolis) and Floric and Florida (Miami) that focus on moving welfare recipients to wo tivate sector involvement TSTES Ue onal GERI au Cierny community as well as business) and highlight the new aT of public agencies.
D1//			Much as i loved The Full Monty, | agree with Cynthia that we should show Blair our kind of welfare reform, not his.
D1//			Another stunning chart! I'm happy going anywhere with Blair on welfare-to-work.
D1//			Andrea sent Bruce and Elena some options several days ago, but with the budget meetings, | don't think they've had a chance to think about them. Bruce had told us that the Presi Ww Blair a model public-private effort moving welfare recipients to work, and he was very interested in Milwaukee. Andrea's also found possible sites in Indiana, Florida, and Maryland -- but | don't know whether Bruce wants to give scheduling options or push for Milwaukee.
D1//			The purpose would be to show Blair how we're reforming welfare in America as he begins to reform welfare in England. This may be an event we would do with the Welfare to Work Partnership {which has been working with companies in England about possibly taunching a Partnership there) -- the Partnership is interested, but we haven't made plans yet.
D0//			Here's what we sent Bruce & Elena-- use your judgement about how much to reveal.
D0//			Do you all want to make a recommendation for a welfare event for the Tony Blair visit? | will make sure scheduling is aware that a request is coming, but if you have any more details before | go into the 4pm short term meeting today it would be great. Thanks.
D1//			The attached document: {1} provides some background on what's going on in U.K. re: welfare reform, {2} lays out--in a chart--options for site visits in four states, and (3) provides additional information about the possible sites. How do you suggest proceeding with scheduling memo--do you want to pick your first choice for a site visit and send that forward, with backup options available as needed, or should we send forward several options? We'd be happy to discuss these sites with you to help narrow it down.
D0//			Background on where things stand in U.K. (based on press clips and recent visits of British officials) Frank Field, the social security minister, has submitted a ‘green paper’ on welfare reform to the PM Blair for review. Apparently this takes a comprehensive, though general, look at reforming a wide range of benefit programs including pensions and disability benefits. Benefits to the disabled are a large and rapidly growing component of welfare spending. Proposals have been floated to cut benefits to the disabled, generating intense ‘opposition from many in the Labour party.
D0//			"On December 10th, Parliament approved a cut in benefits for lone (single) parents. This was supported by Blair, Social Security secretary Harriet Harman, and Chancellor Gordon Brown. Apparently this was necessary to meet the budget targets set by the Tory Government. The proposal created a major revolt by Labour backbenchers, leading to several resignations, and 47 Labour MPs voting against the proposal. Blair and Brown justified their position as one of the ‘hard choices’ that Labour must make, demonstrating a commitment to live within tough spending limits and consistent with weaning single parents from welfare to work. As part of the package, Brown announced a new child care program and a “New Deal"" jobs program to help people move into work. The cuts, and the new programs, are scheduled for implementation in April."
D0//			"Concern about promoting responsibility, reducing dependency, and addressing underclass. One in 3 children in Britain are born out of wedlock. On December 8th, Blair launched a new ""Social Exclusion Unit"" intended to prevent the further development of an underclass. This group will focus on: tackling the problems of school expulsion and chronic truancy, reducing the number of people sleeping on the streets, and improving the qualify of life on the worst ‘housing estates’ (presumably, and ironically, this translates to housing projects in U.S. English)."
D0//			Interest in requiring single parents to work sooner. Currently they are able to collect benefits until their youngest child is 16. They are now being invited in on a voluntary basis to participate in employment and training assistance. It remains to be seen whether this will occur on a large scale--funding is not adequate to make it mandatory.
D0//			Time limits, contracting/privatization, teen parent residency requirement are apparently off the table.
D0//			Commitment to some form of safety net--empower rather than punish.
D0//			Trying to break cycle of dependency--may be focusing initially on young people (18-24) who are unemployed, come from dependent households, etc.
D0//			Welfare reform in Britain appears to be more directly motivated by budget issues than in U.S.
D0//			Interested in improving Job Centres (if anyone saw Full Monty, they don't look very effective!).
D0//			At end of September, Blair gave first address to Labour's annual conference. Themes were very familiar: Shift from looking at people's barriers to their resources, disability to ability, new role for public sector (organizer, regulator, cajole, compel people to work, no longer the safety net).
D0//			° Interested in encouraging those who have been disabled and unemployed to return to work. This includes many unemployed men with'redundant' skills,  e.g. steel workers and miners.

D0//			ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT SITES: MARYLAND (1) The state has a contract with Giant Foods to train and place approximately 80 people. To date, Giant has hired 45 welfare recipients. This is a partnership between Giant, the PIC, and the local welfare office in Prince Georges County. Giant provides the PIC with hiring requirements. The local welfare office identifies possible candidates and does initial screening and selection. Those who meet criteria go to PIC for a two week pre-employment training. Giant hires and provides 6 weeks of paid on the job training (funded by the state). Individuals are hired as cashiers, pharmacy and bakery clerks, and meat wrappers, as union employees with full benefits and wages commensurate with others in the food industry. A job coach is available to help people succeed on the job and work with the local welfare agency to solve problems, arrange support services, etc. The fact that individuals are welfare recipients is kept confidential and invisible to other employees. Initial numbers look good and apparently clients are clamoring to join this program.
D0//			Site information: training takes place at Giant's training facility in Greenbelt. MD. Welfare recipients participate in the same training as other new hires. Visit could either be to the training facility or to a Giant store, though the training facility would probably make more sense.
D0//			(2) Anne Arundel County has a one-stop job center that has gotten a lot of positive attention. It integrates the Department of Labor's automated job bank and social services at one site and provides lots of flexibility to provide whatever services people need to get employed and leave welfare. The center serves as a single point of contact for any job seeker (welfare or not). Maryland staff indicate this makes a good visit.
D0//			(3) The Job Connection is a public-private partnership with local departments of welfare, small businesses, local chambers of commerce and APG (a national consulting firm that supports small businesses}. The goal is to place 2,500 welfare recipients over the next 27 months. The project has been operating for several months. Small businesses notify the Job Connection (via a 1-800 number) when they have a vacancy. The Job Connection geocodes the job location, and provides geocoded information about nearby supportive services, i.e. child care and transportation. They then fax this information to the local welfare department, who has 72 hours to respond with job candidates. Once someone is hired, APG and the Chamber help the small business qualify for federal and state tax credits.
D0//			Site information: The Job Connection is based in Columbia, MD. Most of the work at the site is ‘virtual'--i.e. by phone and fax. We could see staff receiving and making referrals and geocoding information, but would not likely see welfare to work participants.
D0//			MILWAUKEE We could visit one of the Wisconsin Works (W-2) Job Centers. These are one-stop employment centers for job seekers and employers. They are each operated by a different private contractor (Goodwill, YW Works, Opportunities Industrialization Center, Maximus, and United Migrant Opportunity Service). The Private Industry Council of Milwaukee serves as the W-2 Contracts Administrator and coordinator for all 5 contractors.
D0//			NOTE: a British parliamentary delegation recently visited Wisconsin, and representatives from Blair's administration attended a recent trans-Atlantic seminar on welfare reform sponsored by Hudson Institute.
D0//			INDIANA Indiana is proud of several welfare reform initiatives. While it is not a county-administered welfare system, there is a strong emphasis on devolution and local involvement in planning and designing welfare reform. Funds are provided to support local initiatives, particularly to build community supports to ensure that people leaving welfare are successful in maintaining employment and self-sufficiency. The state feels it has successfully gone through the culture change to work first (confirmed in a recent Abt evaluation). It is now dealing with the next stage, i.e. what happens once someone gets a job and leaves welfare. They are focusing on life long learning and increasingly partnering with businesses to address the longer term self-sufficiency issues. [I will follow up after the W2W Partnership event on 12/15 to get suggestions on a possible site to visit.]
D0//			They have just launched a major public-private partnership on child care with large companies putting private dollars into a fund to support child care initiatives around the state (not restricted to current/former welfare recipients). Indiana has transferred $62 million in TANF savings to the CCDF to boost child care funds available for working families. Like many places, Indiana finds transportation to be a major challenge. The state is about to award $5 million in ‘barrier busting’ grants to localities, with about 85% of the grants focusing on transportation. Particularly in rural and suburban areas, mass transit is not sufficient to address the needs of welfare recipients going to work. Local areas will use funds to help people repair cars, make car loans, pay for drivers licenses, etc.
D0//			FYI: A class action suit on family cap was recently filed in Indiana.
D0//			FLORIDA Staff in the Governor's Washington office is exploring potential initiatives sites with state staff and will get back to us by the end of the week with some ideas. They have suggested coordinating the State WAGES board (the private/public board governing the program) as well as the local WAGES coalition wherever we might want to visit. Generally, Florida's welfare reform program is thoughtful, well managed, relatively mature. One interesting item that I'm getting more information about--they have evidence of improved school performance of children whose parents went to work through welfare reform.
D0//			Florida has invested significant state funds in child care and has a Child Care Purchasing Pool to provide subsidies to low-income working parents who would otherwise be on waiting lists. Public funds are matched dollar for dollar with privates local fensls .
D0//			Just a heads up...| ran into Nicholas, public policy editor for the Financial Times of London, at the NGA policy forum last week. He mentioned that he was working through Dan Balz of  the Washington Post to try to get an interview on welfare reform, and said Balz had contacted Bruce. Apparently Timmins had arranged an interview for Balz with Tony Blair or some high level British official and now Balz is trying to reciprocate. Timmins is spending several months studying and writing about welfare reform in the U.S. Without revealing anything about the upcoming Blair visit, | took the opportunity to ask Nicholas about what's going on with welfare reform in the U.K.
D0//			Key points: e@ Rhetoric from U.S. continues to play big in U.K., though in practice their strategies have a different focus.
D0//			@ Major focus right now is primarily on unemployed males. Many of the men are structurally employed, i.e. laid off steel workers whose skills have become ‘redundant’.
D0//			@ Lone (single) parents are a secondary focus. Currently they are able to collect benefits until their youngest child is 16. They are now being invited in on a voluntary basis to participate in employment and training assistance. It remains to be seen whether this will occur on a large scale--funding is not adequate to make it mandatory.
D0//			The following are potential policy announcements you could make at the upcoming Summit on service and in the radio address on Saturday.
D1//			RADIO ADDRESS You will announce that we are sending our America Reads legislation to the Hill, and use that opportunity to emphasize AmeriCorps’ role in America Reads. You can also talk about your vision of the Summit and highlight America Reads as a great example of meeting the Summit’s challenge on volunteering, tutoring, and literacy. In addition, you can announce that Federal agencies are making a “commitment” to the Summit that they will expand the number of schools that they have adopted or established partnerships with from approximately 1,500 schools to 2,000 schools by the year 2000. Working through partnerships established by their agencies, Federal employees tutor, purchase equipment, and hold career days.
D0//			MONDAY SPEECH AT SUMMIT When you laid out your original vision of national service back in 1992, you set forth two fundamental principles that captured the public imagination: first, that all young Americans willing to give something back should have the chance to get help for college; and second, that we should challenge those young people to help solve our toughest problems, “as teachers, police officers, child care workers -- doing work our country desperately needs,” as you said in the first Georgetown speech.
D0//			AmeriCorps, though still a well-kept secret, has gone a long way toward realizing your overall ideal of citizen service. But for budgetary and partisan political reasons, it will not become universal anytime soon, and because of its decentralized structure, AmeriCorps has not succeeded in marshaling a nation-wide effort to target a compelling national problem like education or crime.
D1//			Your speech in Philadelphia is a chance to breathe new life into that original ideal. We can’t escape the budgetary constraints, but we can give more young people an incentive to serve, and most important, we can set forth a clear national mission of the problems we need them to solve.
D0//			The following proposal are designed with that in mind. 1. Interest-free Year of Service As you know, Rev. Tony Campolo has urged you to make it easier for college students and recent graduates to take a year off for service. Thanks to your income-contingent loan program and to earlier changes allowing loan deferments for service, students can already take advantage of reduced loan payments if they take low-paying service jobs, and can take time off for service without having to begin repayment of their loans. Your FY98 budget also includes a proposal to encourage service by no longer treating loan forgiveness as taxable income, so that students who universities forgive their loans will no longer have to pay taxes on it.
D1//			The only remaining barrier is the interest that accumulates on unsubsidized loans during the period of service. The cost of having the Federal government pay that interest is minimal -- $7 million over 5 years. This is an inexpensive proposal, and the typical benefit is not enormous, but it would make this policy universal, and it would allow any young person to take time off to serve without increasing his or her debt burden. The Education Department has expressed some concerns about this.
D1//			2. Police Corps  You can announce $20 million in grants to 17 states for the Police Corps program. The Police Corps was created in your 1994 Crime Bill to increase the number of community police officers with advanced education and training, and was one of your pledges during the 1992 presidential campaign. :
D1//			The Police Corps offers educational assistance to qualified college students who commit to enter the police after graduation and serve in the force for at least four years. Students accepted into the Police Corps receive up to $7,500 in educational assistance for up to four years of undergraduate study. In addition, Corps recruits receive 16 weeks of rigorous training to help make them effective community police officers. As an incentive to police departments to take recruits, state and local law enforcement agencies receive cash assistance for employing Police Corps officers -- $10,000 per participant for each year of the recruit’s service.
D1//			This announcement nearly triples the number of states that will receive Police Corps funds, from 6 to 17 states, and is double the funding appropriated in FY 1996 for the program. It will fund about 650 recruits. Your FY 1998 budget contains $20 million in funding for Police Corps.
D1//			3. Teacher Corps We believe your Summit speech should include a ringing call to service for young people to teach in inner cities. Nothing would do more to breathe new life into the ethic of service than to enlist young Americans in a national effort to transform inner-city schools that are crying out for their energy, idealism, and talent.
D1//			One way to do this would be to announce the proposal described below, which provides $400 million over four years in incentives for approximately 48,000 new teachers. If this seems too costly to propose in the current budget environment, it could be ramped up more slowly at about half the cost and impact. You could also propose a more modest expansion of AmeriCorps’ support for Teach for America, as long as we also address quality concerns about that program. Alternatively, your speech could simply include a strong call to young people to take up the challenge of teaching in inner cities without proposing a new initiative to provide federal support. Such an initiative could still be included in the Administration’s Higher Education Act proposal, which will be transmitted this summer.
D0//			Over the next decade, the nation will need to hire some 2.3 million teachers. Of these, approximately 15%, or 345,000 (approximately 35,000 per year), will be hired in central cities, in schools with large concentrations of low income students. An additional 207,000 (approximately 20,000 per year) will be needed in isolated, and often poor, rural areas. These types of communities face the greatest difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified teachers. Urban areas in particular receive significantly fewer applications for positions than neighboring suburban districts, and attrition rates in urban areas can often reach 30% to 50% in the first five years. They are therefore most likely to fill classroom vacancies with teachers who lack preparation, don’t meet licensure requirements, or who are teaching outside their field. As a result, the students in these communities -- who need the most qualified teachers in order to meet higher academic standards -- often get exactly the opposite in the classroom.
D1//			We propose a new national effort to help attract and retain teachers in high poverty central city and rural schools. This new initiative would be a part of the Administration’s proposal for the reauthorization of Title V of the Higher Education Act. The basic framework for this initiative could be announced at the summit, while many of the details could be further  developed by the Education Department over the coming months.
D1//			This initiative would provide competitive grants to 100 local partnerships involving urban or rural school districts and institutions of higher education, to be used to provide incentives for individuals to prepare to teach, and to remain, in underserved schools. These would include 2-3 year fellowships for undergraduate students (including for a “Sth year” program that provides intensive and sustained classroom experience for undergraduates after they have acquired a strong liberal arts background); one-year graduate fellowships for post-baccalaureate students, including recent liberal arts graduate and mid-career professionals seeking to enter teaching; stipends for teachers’ aides and other education.paraprofessionals seeking to move up a career ladder into full teaching positions; and 1-2 year “residencies” for beginning teachers that would provide a lighter teaching load coupled with additional time for class preparation, being coached or mentored, or working in other ways with more experienced teachers.
D1//			The incentives would range from fellowships that cover tuition and fees (which average $3,500 at undergraduate public institutions) to forgivable loans to salary supplements for beginning teachers. Successful competitors would have to demonstrate that they have a high quality teacher preparation program, and that the program fits into a comprehensive, thoughtful strategy for recruiting and retaining teachers.
D1//			The Education Department proposes to fund this initiative at $100 million a year for five years, beginning with the FY1999 budget. The Education Department estimates that this initiative will help attract and retain at least 48,000 teachers into high poverty central city and rural schools. This is approximately 17% of the estimated need in those communities. This is not an issue for this year’s appropriations battles, and we have not tried to identify a specific offset. However, it will compete with your other discretionary priorities in the out-years. If you wish to proceed, we will work with OMB to determine what funding level we can commit to right now, recognizing that the parameters of NDD spending may change before we submit the FY99 budget.
D1//			We are also exploring ways to link this initiative to AmeriCorps, which already provides scholarships (but no stipends) to 1,000 teachers in Teach for America. As you know, Teach for . America has been fairly successful in capturing the imagination of the public and of college students, but to this point has not provided the preparation and support those new teachers need to succeed in the classroom and remain in the profession. We could use existing scholarship funds to expand AmeriCorps’ commitment to Teach for America, but we should also look for ways to make sure that preparation needs are addressed.
D1//			4. Child Care Corps You could also announce that you will expand AmeriCorps to include a new child care corps. The child care field has great difficulty attracting and retaining qualified workers, especially well-educated and trained workers who can go on to become leaders in the field. Your recent conference on early learning was the latest confirmation that it is critical to increase the quality of child care. Yet very few of our most talented young people enter this field.
D1//			The program would offer AmeriCorps scholarships to individuals who agree to work in child care in low-income areas for two years. It would be open both to those currently working in the field and to those seeking to enter. Members of the corps would not get a stipend from AmeriCorps, but a scholarship of $4,725 a year for two years, which could be used either to repay existing student loans or to pay for further education. Some of these scholarships could be earmarked to help people leaving welfare to get college training to become child care workers.
D1//			The Corporation for National Service estimates that it could support a corps of 2,000 people a year without any increase in their budget or permission from Congress, as long as these individuals get only scholarships and not stipends as well. Under pressure from members of Congress to reduce the cost of an AmeriCorps member, the Corporation has begun to emphasize these “scholarship only” awards, and its scholarship trust fund has excess funds.
D1//			Non-profit groups would apply to become part of this program, and would have to demonstrate that they could offer participants high-quality training and mentoring during their two years of service, including development of management and leadership skills. In addition, corporations could sponsor members by paying for their salaries, and universities that specialize in early childhood education could match our scholarships.
D0//			5. Mentoring/Tutoring 1 Million Kids In preparation for the Summit, Federal agencies have joined their counterparts in the private and non-profit sectors by making public “commitments” to the goals of the Summit. Agencies have identified over 40 initiatives where they will work with partners in the volunteer or service sectors to mentor and tutor kids, expand afterschool programs, and offer young people opportunities to serve. We are trying to determine whether these commitments add up to an additional 1 million kids being mentored or tutored as a result of Federal government efforts.
D1//			FIRST LADY SPEECH AT CLOSING CEREMONY The First Lady will represent the Administration at the closing ceremony on Tuesday. We are exploring the option that she could announce Kaiser Permanente’s commitment of $100 million over the next five years to provide health coverage to 50,000 children in California.
D0//			Police youth academies are active in many Communities across the country.' The structure and participants vary greatly from program to program, but each one is structured around creating constructive interactions between police and young people. Most of the existing  Programs are co-sponsored by law enforcement agencies and schools or community groups, including Kiwanis, YMCA, scouting organizations, and business groups.
D0//			Components of Police Youth Academies Current academies contain some or all of the following program elements:  - basic orientation to law enforcement (arrest procedures, search procedures, ethics) ~ physical fitness and sports; - orientation to law enforcement as a career (challenges, responsibilities); - conflict resolution and dealing with peer pressure; - role-playing exercises for police-youth interactions; - field trips to jails, courts, training facilities, etc.; - antigang and drug programs; - building self-esteem and attitude management; - tutoring.
D0//			Structure and Participants The range for participant ages varies from elementary school students (Delray, FL Kids and COPS Academy and Dekalb County, GA Junior Police Academy) to high school-level and older (NYPD Youth Academy, Howard County, MD Youth Police Academy). Some programs are structured as periodic after-school or evening programs (Dayton, OH Youth Police Academy) or month-long summer programs (Enfield, CT), while others are more intensive, Los Angeles has considered a full-time magnet-like high school program modeled on a youth police academy.
D0//			Some programs allow any interested young person to apply. Some programs are adjuncts to other programs (such as the Boy Scouts’ Police Explorer program), and thus participants are drawn from that pool. Others base participation on referrals from teachers, school officials or the police themselves in light of disciplinary matters or minor skirmishes with police.
D0//			The Athol, MA Youth Police Academy confers academic “extra credit” on its participants.
D0//			* Our survey of press reports turned up Police Youth Academies in Athol, MA; Enfield, CT; Orange County, CA; New York, NY; Hartford, CT; Portland, OR; Howard County, MD; Los Angeles, CA; Garland, TX; Kansas City, MO; Delray, FL; Dayton, OH; Dekalb County, GA.
D0//			Current Availability of Federal Funding There does not appear to be a realistic prospect of committing any FY 97 J ustice resources to directly support police youth academies. Although the Bureau of Justice Assistance was appropriated a relatively small amount of truly discretionary funding, BJA already has issued program plans and solicitations that account for all of the available funding.
D0//			The COPS statute, as enacted, would permit the Department of Justice’s COPS Office to make discretionary grants to support police youth academies. See 42 U.S.C. § 3796dd d)(5), (7) (grants authorized to develop and implement “citizens’ police academy” and to “establish and implement innovative programs to increase and enhance proactive crime control and prevention programs involving law enforcement officers and young persons in the community”). Although the authorizing language permits such grants, the restrictions placed on COPS’ FY 96 and FY 97 appropriations prevent COPS from makin, grants for oses other than hiring and needed to permit grants tobemmaeinderthisprovison
D0//			The Law Enforcement Scholarships and Recruitment Act, 42 U.S.C. § 14111 et seq, passed as part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, authorizes funds to be provided to states to pay costs of part-time or summer employment for high school juniors and seniors which consists of “performing meaningful tasks that inform students of the nature of the tasks performed by law enforcement agencies.” Although none of the police youth academy programs that we have identified currently provides paid employment to its participants, one could design an academy-type program building on a job assignment of some sort. No funds have been appropriated to implement the Law Enforcement Scholarships and Recruitment Act to date. Moreover, the authorization of appropriations provision states that of funds appropriated for this Act, only 20% may be used to provide employment, while 80% must be used to provide scholarships for career law enforcement officers.
D1//			Other Considerations While many of the police youth academies currently in operation appear to be popular and successful, it is our perception that a decision to make federal funding of police youth academies a priority would be greeted at best skeptically by police management and labor  organizations, and most likely with some degree of resentment or hostility 6; expeciations that already exist for the use of Crime Act funding, We currently are facine ene g. We currently are facing significant unmet demand for funding to support more “core” law enforcement o erations, such as for technology, continuation of expiring domestic violence iniiatives, and forthe law enforcement scholarshyy described above. In addition, the past and current appropriations for the Police Corps program, while the Law Enforcement Scholarship program remains unfunded, has engendered  dissatisfaction from many quarters in law enforcement that would be exacerbated by funding additional programs not benefiting police more directly.
T0//			| shared the memo below with Mike Smith and Terry Dozier this morning. They are ok with the plan | laid out, which is along the lines Bruce and | discussed on Friday. They are working to flesh out the details; while | am gone this afternoon, Bill Kincaid will work with them and with you in preparation for tomorrow's memo.
D1//			| also talked briefly with Ritey this morning -- before | had a chance to talk with Mike and Terry -he's not up on the details of any of this, but he likes the fact that the President wants to talk about this at the summit, and will likely go along with anything Mike, Terry and | agree to.
D1//			Thanks for the update to the memo, and to Maureen for the original and the faxed cost info. | think we need to pick things up a bit as we approach the summit. .! don't think we will need a full-blown, comprehensive and complete proposal, but | think we need something for the President to talk about in his speech. Nobody here, including me,thinks the President will be satisfied with or well served by simply talking about options and appointing a task force to come up with a plan. This approach will fail to capitalize on the incredible media attention at the summit, and may not sufficiently focus attention on the importance of attracting well prepared people into teaching. Further, we can waste an awful lot of time just appointing and organizing a task force, time which could otherwise be spent fleshing out a legislative proposal and consulting informally and extensively.
D1//			As | read this and talk to others, it seems to be there are a couple of components to what the President could do, without reaching premature closure.
D1//			First, he can talk about what the federal government already does to make it =easier for people to go into teaching -- Perkins loan cancellation/forgiveness, and income contingent repayment. There are also more specific programs underway -- National Service funds an urban education service corps, and | think there is a troops-to-teachers program, but | don’t know much about it.
D1//			Second, | think there is a core idea emerging in our discussions and your materials -- a focus on attracting and retaining well prepared teachers in underserved urban and rural areas. It would be great if the President could announce the framework of an initiative to address this, leaving the details to be worked out later. | would suggest the following:
D1//			@ acompetitive program, aimed at partnerships between city school districts, IHE's (colleges of ed and arts and sciences) and others as appropriate, including unions, existing recruitment and/or professional networks, etc.
D1//			@ competitors have to show that they have a quality preparation program strategy, and that they are locating this program in a comprehensive, well thought out strategy for recruiting and retaining teachers, which addresses teacher preparation, induction, ongoing professional development, and which leverages other local, state and federal resources in a strategic and ‘coordinated fashion
D1//			"e@ that gives each partnership funds to use to attract and retain well prepared teachers -- they can figure out themselves the mix most appropriate to target, including undergraduates  e.g., four 2-4 year fellowships that require a year-for-year committment to teach}, individuals who have completed a 4 year degree (e.g, seniors with a liberal arts degree or mid-career professionals who want to enter teaching) who will need an intensive ""5th year"", and paraprofessionals who will continue working and get financial help for college tuition as they work toward licensure."
D1//			if the President were to announce a program centered on these components, he would make clear that this will be part of the Administrations HEA Title 5 reauthorization, to be transmitted later in the Spring or Summer (It appears that you are aiming for late September, though at one point | thought you were aiming for June}. | don't think we need a lot of details for something like this, though we would need to figure out how much we would be prepared to spend, starting in FY 99. We would also need to make some assumptions about the size of fellowships, and possible ways of dividing up funds between the three types of prospective teachers described above, so that we could estimate a range of teacher slots that would be filled through this initiative.
D1//			Third, there may some simple and appropriate steps that could be taken, or at least proposed, without much cost or complexity. For example, what about making it easier for students to use work-study funds to pay for time they spend student teaching?
D1//			Fourth, there clearly are other options to consider -- expanded loan forgiveness, tax breaks, etc. {though these approaches seem to me to be too costly, insufficiently targeted, and unlikely to make a real impact). These and other options you may want to consider should not be foreclosed by a . Presidential proposal at the summit.
D1//			t think approach along these lines will give the President what just about everybody here seems to think he needs next week, while not unduly tying the hands of the Department as you proceed. This presumes that we can work our way through several things over the next few days -- (1} whether the Department is prepared to commit to an urban-focused initiative; (2) if so, the overall framework for it; and (3) a minimum tevel of investment for it, with the understanding that we will figure out how to pay for it during the FY 99 budget decisions. This assumes that we would be announcing something on the modest size. | would guess in the $80-$100 million range of 4-5 years.
D1//			Elena and | talked to Justice this morning about the announcement. They have been fighting us on this all the way. It is a $19 billion Department that can't find a few million for this program.
D1//			They now contend that they -- in effect -- already fund a Police Youth Academy program through their inservice scholarship program (that was created in the '94 Crime Bill)
D0//			"The Crime Bill requires 20% of that program to be set aside for states to pay the costs of part-time or summer employment for high school juniors and seniors which consists of ""performing meaningful tasks that inform students of the nature of the tasks performed by law enforcment agencies."""
D0//			Our FY 98 budget submission asks for $20 million for the inservice scholarship program, so that that means we have a $4 million request for a police youth academy program.
D1//			Justice.said they would get back to us on whether the $4 million can only be used for salaries for the kids or whether it could be interpreted to be used for the cost of setting up the program.
D1//			If it is the former only, then we asked them to drait us legislation that would expand this program and the President could announce that he is sending it to the Hill -- and he could also announce guidelines for the $4 million program.
D1//			If it is the latter, we asked them to draft guidelines for this program that we could announce at the Service Summit.
D1//			Do you want me to write something up for this for the President's announcement memo or should | wait until | get more info from Justice? Or do you want me to get the hell out of here because | am getting rolled by the Justice Department?
D0//			At the President’s Summit for America’s Future, President Clinton announced new proposals to expand service and mutual responsibility nationwide: President Clinton announced new AmeriCorps Challenge Scholarships -- asking charities, religious groups, and community groups to enlist young people for a year of full-time service, and giving those young people AmeriCorps scholarships in return. If the private  and non-profit sectors rise to this challenge, these scholarships would go to as many as 50,000 young people with money that is already in the President’s balanced budget.
D0//			President Clinton challenged every state and every school system to offer young people the chance to serve -- to help teach them the responsibility of citizenship.
D0//			President Clinton announced new legislation to allow any young person with a college loan to take a year to serve without accruing additional interest on that loan.
D0//			President Clinton announced the expansion the Police Corps, to triple the number of young people who can earn four years of college by agreeing to serve at least four years as police officers, and challenged young people to become teachers where they are needed most -- in America’s central cities.
D0//			In his speech this morning, President Clinton said that “The era of big government is over, but big challenges remain. We are here to proclaim: the era of big citizenship has begun.”
D0//			The President issued a call to action to all Americans to serve our children, and to help teach them to serve -- not as a substitute for government, but to meet our major challenges as one community, working together.
D0//			The President emphasized that even with all the progress our nation has made -- 12 million new jobs, falling crime and welfare rolls -- we still face enormous challenges. But the toughest of these are challenges of the heart -- ones that must be faced person by person, neighbor by neighbor, community by community. That is why restoring an ethic of service and mutual responsibility is so important.
D0//			50,000 AMERICORPS CHALLENGE SCHOLARSHIPS . Today the President is proposing a dramatic expansion in AmeriCorps through a new type of award that makes scholarships available when charities, non-profits, and religious organizations take on young people to perform a year of service.
D0//			These 50,000 new scholarship awards represent a revolutionary partnership between the public, private, and nonprofit sectors: AmeriCorps provides the scholarship ($4,725 for a year of full-time service); charities, nonprofits, and religious organizations provide the opportunity to serve; and the private sector can help underwrite the organization's costs. The President is challenging these organizations to put AmeriCorps members to work, and ~ challenging businesses té sponsor AmeriCorps members at organizations that need private sector help.
D0//			Offering More Scholarships for Service -- Unlike other AmeriCorps programs, this award provides only a scholarship and requires organizations (rather than the federal government) to cover the cost of living expenses for AmeriCorps members. Because these awards cost about a third as much as other AmeriCorps awards, this expansion can be achieved without additional spending beyond the Administration’s budget plan, and AmeriCorps can add a net total of approximately 33,000 members over the next five years.
D0//			Using this new approach, AmeriCorps awarded 1,600 scholarships in .1996, and has awarded 1,750 so far this year. AmeriCorps is currently evaluating applications for an additional 6,100 scholarships. The President proposes that AmeriCorps award 50,000 more of these scholarships over the next 5 years.
D0//			At that rate, by the year 2000, the Administration will have given over 190,000 young people the chance to'serve in AmeriCorps. This is more than will have served in the entire 40-year history of the Peace Corps -- a remarkable achicvement when you consider the enormous contribution that Peace Corps volunteers have made and continue to make today. If Congress passes the Administration's proposed increase in AmeriCorps funding to pay for 11,000 volunteer coordinators as part of the America Reads initiative, AmeriCorps will reach that level even sooner.
D0//			Opportunities for New Partnerships -- Non-profit organizations -- especially faith-based proups ~ are already showing a great interest in this new type of AmeriCorps membcr. Examples of organizations that have already been awarded these scholarships include:
D0//			. The National Council of Churches is using 1,600 scholarships awarded last year to put AmeriCorps members to work serving in child care, tutoring, and teaching and assisting.in schools: The group is seeking a significant expansion next year.
D0//			The Boys and Girls Clubs of America will usc 900 AmeriCorps scholarships to support critically-needed service in up to 100 of their 2,200 clubs nationally.
D0//			The Mississippi Department of Education will place 100 AmeriCorps members as: assistant teachers in elementary classrooms, expecting that many of these individuals will use their educational benefits to'pursue teaching careers.
D0//			. West Virginia University will have 425 AmeriCorps members invalved in intensive educational outreach, support, and enrichment for children in particularly needy areas of the state over the summer. :
D0//			The private sector can help other non-profit groups take advantage of these scholarships. While some non-profit organizations can support full-time servers, others. might be interested in this approach but unable to pay a living allowance themselves. Corporate help will allow non-profits to carry on the work of the Presidents’ Summit.
D0//			Moviug Ahead on the Summit's Goals -- These new AmeriCorps members can play a. critical role in following up on the important goals of the Summit —~ teaching children to read, mentoring children at risk, providing safe Spaces after school, ensuring children get immunizations, and organizing the work of volunteers, Every AmeriCorps member recruits or trains an average of twelve volunteers.
D0//			EXPANDING TAR POLICE CORPS ' Today the President announced an expansion of the Police Corps through $20 taillion in erants to 17 states, tripling the number of recruits funded. Created by the President's 1994 Crime Bill to increase the number of community police officers with advanced , education and taining, the Police Corps offers scholarships to qualified college students who commit to serve as police officers for at least four years after graduation.
D0//			The program provides up to $7,500 a year to Police Corps. recruits for tuition, room, board, and books at the 4-year college or university of their choice. After a 16-week training course following graduation, Police Corps recruits agree to serve for four years as sworn officers. As an additional incentive, Police Corps will provide $10,000 per recruit per year to state and local police departments that employ Police Corps officers.
D0//			The expansion will place Police Corps recruits in Connecticut, Georgia, Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, Ohio, Texas, and Washington. Programs funded last year and continuing this year are in Arkansas, Maryland, Nevada, North Carolina, Oregon and South Carolina. The total number of recruits will be 672.
D0//			In addition, Police Corps funds are available in participating states, to the dependent : children of police officers killed in the line of duty. These scholarships can be applied to any course of study, without any service or obligation to repay.
D0//			MAKING IT EASIER FOR STUDENTS TO SERVE / The President plans to propose legislation that will allow any young person to take a year off during or after college to serve without increasing the amount he or she owes in student loans.
D0//			The President has already made it possible for students to take low-paying service jobs and keep their loan payments affordable, thanks to the Administration's income contingent loan program enacted in 1993. In addition, the President's 1998 budget would encourage service by no longer treating loan forgiveness duc to service as taxable income — so that students whose universities forgive thcir loans because they havc taken low-paying service _ jobs will no longer have to pay taxes on it.
D0//			This new proposal will help students with unsubsidized loans who seek loan deferments while they take some time off for service. The President will. propose legislation to have the government pay the interest that accumulates on unstibsidized loans for up to 3 years of service. This would allow at least-12,000 student borrowers to avoid accumulating an’ average of $600 in extra interest on theie student loans for a year of service,
D0//			SERVICE IN ELEMENTARY, JUNIOR HIGH, AND HIGH SCHOOL --~‘The President repeated his call for school districts and states to follow the example of the state of Maryland and other communities by giving all young people the chance to serve.
D0//			"COMMITMENTS BY FEDERAL AGENCIES Federal agencies are making over 40 commitments to the Presidents’ Summit for America’s Future, building on the wide range of partnerships that the federal government has with the non-profit and voluntary sector. Federal agencies will increase the number "" of schools they have adopted or established partnerships with from 1,500 to 2,000 by the year 2000. The Department of Defense will reach over one million students through mentoring, tutoring, and training. By the year 2000, the Department of Transportation will reach one million students through mentoring, tutoring, and education materials by working with corporate partners. :"
D1//			Take the attached to a meeting and try and skim them if you have a chance. My gut feeling about the bottom line is this: TFA is controversial {by definition, given the following articles), but clearly defensible. Much of the criticism seems to come from a small cadre of self-appointed critics from Ed Schools. There are certainly individual anecdotes of TFA failures, but it's not as if there's a shortage of Ed School trained teacher failure stories either...
D0//			One other observation: How come every single article mentions AmeriCorps? What's that all about? Duhhh.
D0//			We found the attached stories on Teach for America. There does seem to be a fair mixture of criticism and praise. Call with questions. Thanks
D0//			She is going to the summit; she was invited by Billy Shor.
D1//			She says she can’t go much beyond the current 900-1,000 for 3 reasons. She says her ideal size would be 1,200! No way could she double it. ‘
D1//			1. They are limited to official teacher shortage areas and have various certification constraints imposed by school districts. So they aren't in lots of places for lots of reasons -- not in Boston be@ause there's a teacher glut; not in Phila she thinks because of rules about certification. She says a lot of the shortage is actually in areas like special ed and bilingual that aren't qualified for. This all seems very different than we thought!
D1//			2. Applicants: She doesn't think she can get more than about 500 high quality people a year. The number of their appticants has shrunk from 3,600 to 2,500 in the last 3 years. They would love to have more applicants, and said if the president wanted to challenge more college students that would be great -- but then | said maybe it wouldn't be because of item 2!
D1//			"3. Management and financial constraints. She suggested that the President call for an expansion of the teacher corps concept into more  professional areas (child care corps, anyone?) to add to the youth corps model of AmeriCorps, which is fine, toward more ""professional"" corps. She is sending me something on this."
D0//			Across the country, law enforcement agencics have adopted community policing as their philosophy of law enforcement. The partnerships created between these agencies and their communities have helped decrease crime nationwide. One way this has been achieved is through the development of police youth academies, programs that promote the constructive interaction between police and young people. Police youth academies increase youth awareness of criminal activities, stress avoiding drugs and gang involvement, teach safety procedures, promote community volunteerism and involvement, and often include efforts to boost children and young adults’ self-esteem and conflict resolution skills. Many of these programs mimic real police academies and as one of their goals strive to promote law enforcement as a career choice for youth. At a time when the youth population in the United States is increasing, it is important that we foster in our young people a respect for and trust in the law and law enforcement and a greater understanding and appreciation of how the police and the community can work together to reduce and prevent violence and crime. Police youth academies help achieve this goal.
D0//			(B) providing -(i) full-time employment in summer; or (ii) part-time (not to exceed 20 hours per week) employment for a period not to exceed 1 year; Of Section 14116(b)(1) is amended to read: ( 1) describe the scholarship program and the student employment 5 ‘for which assistance under this subtitle is sought;
D0//			OVERVIEW Law enforcement agencies across the country are focusing increased attention on fostering positive relationships between officers and youth. Ata time when the youth population in the United States is increasing, these agencies recognize the importance of our young people developing a greater understanding and appreciation of how the police and the community can work together to reduce and prevent violence and crime. These initiatives take on many forms ranging from in-schoo! education classes on drugs and gangs, to after-school sports programs that promote self-esteem and keep kids off the streets.
D0//			As part of their enhanced efforts, many law enforcement agencies are developing police youth academies. Like the broader spectrum of youth-oriented programs, these academies vary greatly depending upon the focus of the program, targeted age group, funding sources, and community involvement. The common thread among these academics, however, is the desire to promote youth understanding of and respect for law enforcement and law enforcement officials. A forum for positive youth-police interaction fosters this goal. The programs increase youth awareness of criminal activities, stress the importance of avoiding drugs and gang involvement, teach safety procedures, promote community volunteerism and involvement, and often include efforts to boost children and young adults’ self-esteem and conflict resolution skills. These programs often mimic real police academies and as one of their goals strive to promote law enforcement asa . career choice for youth.
D0//			"Many police youth academies are the result of partnerships between a law enforcement agency and schools, community organizations such as scouting groups, and/or local businesses. Some of the programs are open to all interested youth while others rely on a referral process to determine who will participate. Teachers, school principals, and police officers often refer ""high risk"" kids to these programs as well as kids who have expressed a interest in pursing a career in law enforcement and student leaders who are likely to share lessons from the academy with their peers."
D0//			EXAMPLES The following descriptions provide a few examples of youth police academies already in operation and making a difference in communities across the country. The core elements of giving young people a chance to have positive interactions with law enforcement officers, providing role models, and building understanding of the role of police are found in all programs, but there is room for great flexibility to construct a program that meets the unique needs ofa‘ communities’ young people.
D0//			New York City Police Department -- “Youth Police Academy” The New York City Police Department (NYPD) Youth Police Academy is a month-long summer program that provides 1,100 kids between the ages of 12 and 17 with the opportunity to interact in a positive way with law enforcement. The program, which is run by the NYPD Youth Division, is active in all five of New York City’s boroughs. In addition to attending lectures on the basics of law enforcement, drug abuse avoidance and gang resistance, the students take part in workshops where they practice conflict resolution techniques and hone their leadership skills through role-playing activities. They also take field trips to local police precincts, courthouses, and district attorneys’ offices to get a firsthand look at the criminal justice system at work.
D0//			The greater New York City community is actively involved in the Youth Police Academy. City and private colleges and universities donate classroom space for the program and local community-based organizations recruit youth to participate.
D0//			Santa Clara Cou CA -- Community Police Academ: ut ogram This academy is designed to provide young people with a clearer understanding of the sheriff's office and its role in law enforcement. In weekly sessions, students study a range of topics including: Traffic Laws and Enforcement, Criminal Law and Juvenile Law, Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Graffiti and Gangs, Ethics, and Narcotics. The academy instructors are volunteers from the sheriff's office. Students also participate in practical exercises involving vehicle stops, officer safety, arrest contro! techniques, and firearms training. All students complete a 10 hour ride-along with a deputy.
D0//			The sheriff's office and school officials select participants for the program through an application process. All participants must meet certain requirements and are subject to a modified * background check. Permission from a student’s parent or guardian is required for anyone under the age of 18.
D0//			San Bernardino, CA Junior and Intermediate Police Academies The San Bemardino Junior Police Academy (JPA) was started in 1990 and is designed to resemble an actual police academy. The JPA is aimed at fifth and sixth graders who once a week during the school day, attend a one-hour law enforcement class. These classes, taught by volunteer instructors, focus on police procedures, prevention, anti-gang information and safety. The students often serve as school safety patrols, lunchroom patrols, and hall monitors. After school, the students gather to practice drilling and marching and to participate in other group activities. They display their marching skills during local parades and appear at safety fairs.
D0//			The Intermediate Police Academy (IPA), started in 1992 in response to the success of the JPA, is structured in much the same way as the JPA, merely targeting older students. Both programs teach the participating students responsibility and instill self-confidence. They challenge the young people physically, mentally and academically.
D0//			JPA and IPA are joint initiatives between the San Bernardino City Unified School District and the San Bernardino Police Department. The programs’ budget, divided between the two sponsors, covers the salaries for two drill instructors and cadet uniforms. The police department funds its portion of the budget with assets seized from drug dealers.
D0//			Teaneck, NJ Police Department- Junior Police Academy The Teaneck Police Department Junior Police Academy is a week-long summer program during which children ages 11 to 14 leam about lifesaving and crime-fighting techniques. The program aims to give children a chance to come into contact with law enforcement in a constructive way so as to quell unnecessary fears about the police. The program typically includes the opportunity to meet FBI and secret service agents, and to get acquainted with members from the county K-9 Unit. The participants visit the police department’s firing range to learn about the dangers of firearms.: They also have the opportunity to become certified in CPR.
D0//			akland, CA Police Department -- Police lorers The Oakland Police Department, in conjunction with the Boy Scouts of America, sponsors the Oakland Police Explorers. The high school youth in this police youth academy learn about law enforcement and become part of a service group that community organizations can call upon to assist with security and crowd supervision at various events.
D0//			altimore, MD Police Department — Youth Police Academ The Baltimore Police Department, in collaboration with the Baltimore Public Schools, has developed a Youth Police Academy at Walbrook Senior High School, one of the city's magnet schools. Students enrolled in this program attend the traditional academic courses. All of their class instruction, however, is presented with a law enforcement emphasis. When discussing speed and distance in a math course, for instance, story problems and examples may be tied to a police report of an accident scene. Two police officers work fulltime at the school, assisting with curriculum development and instructing teachers about the police department and crime issues.
D0//			Kansas City, MO -- Police Cadet Program The Kansas City Police Department, along with local businesses and three area colleges, sponsors a Police Cadet Program that targets minority youth, With the exception of the age and educational requirements, participants must meet the standard requirements for entry into the Kansas City Police Department.
D0//			The program provides participants with a 40-hour per week paid internship in the Police Department the summer between their two years of college and also funds the students’ two years of college. In exchange, participants agree to enter the Kansas City Police Academy upon completion of their college coursework and to serve as a police officer for at least three years after graduating from the Academy.
D0//			Other youth police academy programs have been greeted with success in communities big and small across the country, including Athol, Massachusetts; Enfield, Connecticut; Orange County, California; Garland, Texas; Portland, Oregon; Howard County, Maryland; Delray, Florida; Dayton, Ohio; Dekalb County, Georgia.
D0//			The Corporation swears that this is true: Teach for America has 900 members now (not 1,000 or 2,200, as they reported to me earlier}, and ALL of them have AmeriCorps scholarships.
D1//			There are 2 ways we could add scholarship-only members of AmeriCorps: one is to tap out the excess in the trust fund, which could add a few thousand members a year; and the other is to modify our budget request so that more of goes to the trust fund and less goes to grants to groups for stipends and other purposes.
D0//			Our 98 budget request for AmeriCorps is $422 million, with $100 million of that recommended to go into the trust fund. Congress gets involved in deciding the split. This funding is supposed to fund 35,000 members (ramp-up is AmericaReads).
D1//			We could madify the split of our budget request without increasing the total. This would be very popular with Grassley; unclear with other members. The question is where to stop. At an extreme, OMB and | did very rough numbers that if we immediately transferred everything into scholarship only, we could fund something like 85,000 more people next year (assuming 40% are part-timers, which I'm not sure of). If we did a major, sudden change, the world that is used to getting AmeriCorps people would have big problems scrambling for all that stipend money, and quite possibly some of the money would go unspent, which would be bad.
D1//			One option is that the increase we are proposing in the size of AmeriCorps could be all scholarship-only, but that could create the expectation that our America Reads people would be the ones who lose out on the stipend. Or maybe you like that idea. ,
D1//			OMB suggested increasing the local match rate over time. Currently applicants pay 15% of the stipend. Increasing that to 25% or 30% would have the effect of freeing up scholarship only money, but it doesn't match the idea of challenging certain folks to come up with the whole stipend. So we need a better idea. ,
D0//			FYI, groups that have applied for scholarship-only include: National Council of Churches, Boys and Girls Clubs, National Neighborhood Housing Network, | Have a Dream Foundation, Earth Conservation Corps, YouthBuild USA, a lot of small state projects, International Youth Organization, National Assoc. of Community Health Centers, and the United Negro College Fund.
D0//			On the cost per AmeriCorps member, here is some info: @ Average cost per AmeriCorps member for fiscal year 1996 -- $17,629. e Agreement with Grassley will reduce that to $17,000 for fiscal year 1997; $16,000 for fiscal year 1998; and $15,000 by fiscal year 1999.
D0//			e Most of that goes directly to the AmeriCorps member (or a school on his/her behalf): ® $6,700 toward a living allowance of $7,600, with the remainder raised by the local sponsor @ $1,200 for barebones health insurance coverage and to assist a few members with child-care costs e@ $4,725 for an education voucher upon completion of at least 1,700 hours of direct service Total Corporation-funded benefits per member: about $12,625.
D0//			e@ Remainder pays for: ® governor-appointed bipartisan commissions that run annual statewide competitions among local nonprofit groups wishing to sponsor AmeriCorps members @ equipment, materials, recruitment, training, and oversight-costs that are being cut as part of the reform agreement with Grassley @ the Corporation
D0//			He wrote about deferral. The President responded in March {Mike Cohen wrote it) that deferments are in fact alréady available, and that the Department would send him some information on that. We then scoured the area for what more we could do, and came up with this. | am trying to reach Campolo in Hawaii to see what he thinks.
D0//			(FYI, Bill Kincaid says reporters are calling the Dept. of Education asking if it's true that the President is going to come out in support of mandatory service requirements at the Summit.)
D0//			"{Also FYI, Teach for America now stands at 2,200 members. According to Gomperts, Eli ""rescued"" the program 2 years ago.)"
D1//			Which did Campolo have in mind? Deferral or forgiveness?
D0//			Bruce -- note well that (as | understand it) this proposal is not to defer, but to forgive the year's worth of interest.
D0//			On student loans and service, here's the story. There are 4 types of breaks on student loans you can offer people who serve.
D1//			1. Income contingency -- We did this in 1993. It says that if you can take a low-paying service job, your loan payments will be only a limited percentage of your income, and ultimately forgiven after 25 years.
D1//			"2. Loan deferment -- This predates us. It is used when (1) someone wants to take time off during school but doesn't want to have to start paying back loans during that time; or (2) someone finishes school, but argues they have a good reason they don't want to start paying back their loans. You can get a deferment for up to 3 years. You are eligible if you are unemployed, or if it would create an ""economic hardship,” which includes service. There is no separate service deferment. There used to be, but the system got so complex that it was simplified in 1992."
D1//			3. Subsidize all loan deferments for service-- This is our new idea. This means that no interest accumulates on loans during the period of service. We already do this for subsidized loans, which are about 2/3 of the volume, so this would fix unsubsidized loans and make it universal.
D1//			The $7 million cost over five years would allow 12,000 borrowers with unsubsidized loans to get this benefit during their deferment. The average benefit would be $600. This estimate assume that no one is induced to serve. If the program cost doubled to $14 million because the subsidized deferment would be more attractive, the number of beneficiaries would increase to 24,000, each receiving $600.
D1//			"In answer to your question as to whether we could do this for more than one year of service: This cost estimate already assumes that this could be for up to 3 years. The estimate simply reflects historical data on people who request a deferment due to economic hardship for ""service-related"" reasons, so it is a mix of people requesting 1, 2, and 3 years of deferments. |.don't think we would want to go past the 3 year point."
D1//			4. Tax Incentives for Student Loan Forgiveness - This is our existing legislative proposal. It says loan forgiveness for service reasons by non-profit charitable or educational institutions should not be taxable. Loan forgiveness by public institutions is already not taxable if it is for service reasons.
D1//			FYI, you will recall that | had been pushing a draft presidential directive to encourage agencies to Implement flexible work schedules to allow fedefel employees to volunteer. Thad an OPM draft circulating, in the hopes it would be ready in time for the summit. However, OMB just informed me that the Labor Dept. has raised a major policy objection to it, saying that it is bad timing with the alternative work schedule bill S4 we are fighti ublicans over on the Hill, and that it would give ammunition to those we are fighting. | haven't had much time to focus on the merits of this objection, figuring this was probably the death knell for this idea, but | can pursue if you want me to.
D0//			The Corporation is touting an alternative to the Teach for America model that they fund based at Notre Dame. For what it's worth, here's the details: .
D1//			Recruits and trains recent college grads to serve as AmeriCorps members teaching in severely undestaffed Catholic parochial schools across the South. Sponsored by Alliance for Catholic Education.
D1//			After 2 intensive summer trainings, two years of university courses, and full time teaching, members earn a Masters of Arts in education. Matched with a.mentor from that school. Their students do service-learning. 80 members last year; good record with principals.
D1//			Here is how | think we need to proceed in order to have something concrete on rewards/incentives for teaching for the President to announce at the service summit:
D0//			1. We need a meeting with key ED staff (Mike Smith, and some combination of David Longanaker, Terry Dozier, Terry Peterson, or whoever Mike thinks would be good), OMB (Ken, or Barry White), and NEC {Bob Shireman) to start developing a set of options.
D1//			2. Bruce--To get this off to the right start, you need to call Mike Smith. | want him to think from the outset that this is not just another, early run on the higher ed. reauthorization proposal for the sake of an event. (At some point he will figure out that it is a specia/early run on the higher ed reauthorization proposal , but hopefully not till we are further downt he road). A call from you, rather than me, telling him that POTUS really wants to do something concrete at the summit, as part of a larger package on the service professions, and perhaps mentioning Riley's call to you about the Summit last night, will set this in the right context for Mike.
D1//			3. In addition to the kind of purpose and design issues we discussed last night -- reward vs. incentive, concentrated vs. spread out, etc. -- we need to figure out some budget parameters here. Does ED have room in current/projected budget? How were they going to pay for this part of their proposal anyway? If we go with a legislative initiative as part of higher ed act, which won't pass for at least a year and more likely the end of this session, then the $ won't start flowing until FY 99 or perhaps 2000. Is this a problem, or does it help?
D0//			Let me know if this makes sense to you, and if you call Mike. Or, you may see him in the cabinet mtg.
D0//			Can Cathy set up the meeting?
D0//			According to Jen Palmieri, the President actually asked to meet with Harris to have a general discussion of some sort on service.
D0//			"| forwarded you a memo Harris sent to the President last week in preparation for this meeting (the one that begins by quoting a 17th century poem, dated January 22). That memo goes beyond service to say that the President's special ""trinity"" of legacy issues are education, service, and race, and that the President should try to show the link between the three -- that they are all about ""one America."" He argues that focusing on the 5. summit goals for children is the way to do this, although | never find that argument totally convincing. Steve Silverman is collecting all the recent Harris missives for the President to review prior to the meeting."
D1//			"The links to race seem most promising -- a town hall taking off from the SOTU, with military, Peace pedple together to serve across racial lines. Also, Gomperts has been talking about proposing a “thinkers” conference on service -- to discuss how to bring service ""up to scale"", and to try to find  common ground with ""compassionate conservatives"" like Coates and Kasich who favor tax credits for charitable contributions to support the volunteer sector."
D1//			| still think this is dopey, and we shouldn't waste a lot of time on it Monday. But it might be nice for the President to say something about it on Tuesday, when he has a big mentoring event at the WH. Can you find out if America's Promise expects any major press on this?
D0//			What are the President and Harris meeting about on Friday?
D0//			Attached is stuff cobbled together from Cabinet Affairs, me, and John Gomperts that will form the basis for the briefing memo on tomorrow's meeting that Cabinet Affairs is putting together.
D1//			We asked Gomperts what Harris might bring up. No big surprises (reauthorization, race), but 2 little ones: First, he may raise exempting AmeriCorps education awards from taxation. Today they are treated as income. It would cost about $14 million; it’s not in the budget. We were thinking about putting it in our reauthorization proposal, but Gomperts decided not to because he feared having to refer the bill to hostile tax committees. Second, Harris may propose that we require more work-study jobs to be service. | recall that you have not been enthusiastic about that idea in the past. The Education Dept. and the higher ed community doesn't like the idea, and | know it risks too much pressure when added to America Reads and the college-school partnerships, but | think it has merit on its own. (There is also a disability item he may raise that is still a mystery to me.)
D0//			The Corporation has accomplished a great deal in the past year, including a growing membership through America Reads and new partnerships with non-profits and faith-based groups; the service summit last April; and the launch of the new high school service scholars program.
D1//			Reauthorization of the Corporation for National Service: This is the Corporation's top priority for this year, and Harris will ask you for your active assistance. He will ask you to send a strong signal to the bipartisan Congressional leadership and the Chairs and Ranking Members of the authorizing committees, as well as key White House offices, that reauthorization is a high priority for your Administration. One option is to hold an event in the next few weeks when we officially transmit our legislation to the Hill.
D0//			Through the service summit and other vehicles, Harris has reached out extensively to Republicans and to those who have not traditionally supported national service in an effort to build bridges between the service and volunteer sectors. While he has made progress, it is not clear which Republicans have joined our cause and would agree to speak out on behalf of reauthorization. General Powell has done PSA's for AmeriCorps and speaks very positively about the program, but he might not agree to endorse legislation. Harris would like to reach out to the “civic renewal/compassionate conservatives” in Congress such as Sen. Coats to seek ways to work together on citizen service that go beyond AmeriCorps, but which will smooth the path for reauthorization.
D0//			Harris may also raise two related items: legislation to exempt AmeriCorps education awards from income tax, and making it more attractive for individuals with disabilities to participate in AmeriCorps. The Corporation decided to drop the tax proposal from its reauthorization proposal late last year because of fears that it would bog down reauthorization. It has a small cost.
D1//			One America: Harris wants to follow up on your “One America” theme from the State of the Union, where you spoke about how citizen service can help us create a common identity, and gave as examples the military, the Peace Corps, and AmeriCorps. He will suggest a White House event (either a Conference or other form of interactive event) in which people from the military, the Peace Corps, and especially young people engaged in national service can draw attention to the ways in which their shared endeavors have led to greater understanding across racial and other differences. Obviously, we would want to work with the Race Initiative and others in creating such an event, but we would look to highlight AmeriCorps and other forms of national service (especially youth service) in this event.
D0//			In addition, Harris may raise the following issues with you: National Volunteer Week: Harris will want us to highlight National Volunteer Week and National Youth Service Day in April to draw attention to the value of youth service. Like the Martin Luther King Day of Service, this annual event is an occasion to showcase AmeriCorps and national service, and will take place around the time of the one-year anniversary of the service summit in Philadelphia. The Corporation might propose that you serve with AmeriCorps, or that you speak out about programs that encourage and reward youth service such as your high school service scholars program (which we hope to expand to 10,000 high schools this year), or the new President's Student Service Awards.
D0//			Work Study: Harris may raise the option of dedicating more work-study funds to service. He will acknowledge that the Department of Education and the higher education community are not enthusiastic about this idea, but he feels that work-study could be a key tool to make youth service more universal and build on the success of America Reads.
D0//			Dear Mr. President, As [ alerted you at Cardozo, this missive is inspired by Andrew Marvel’s 17° century poem about “time’s winged chariot,” and by the realization that you have a little more than a thousand days left in your presidency.
D0//			Had we but world enough, and time, This coyness, Lady, were no-crime... But at my back I always hear Time's winged chariot hurrying near, And yonder all before us lie Deserts of vast eternity.
D0//			Now therefore, while the youthful hue Sits on thy skin like morning dew... Rather at once our time devour Than languish in his slow-chapt power. Let us roll all our strength and all Our sweetness up into one ball... Thus, though we cannot make our sun Stand still, yet we will make him run.
D0//			As you may guess, my proposition is that the time has come for you to do everything in your power to roll all your “strength” and all your “sweetness” up into one ball. And that the time to begin trying to do that is your State of the Union address. My pitch goes beyond AmeriCorps and national service — though they are central and the reauthorization for the Corporation for National Service needs your championship in the address to Congress and months to follow. I write here not so much as an agent for AmeriCorps but, if I may be so bold, as a coach for America’s future and for the next thousand days of your Presidency.
D0//			As an old civil rights hand and a veteran not only of national service, but also of the Peace Corps and higher education over the years, I see you on the brink of truly becoming the Education President, the Citizen Service President, and the President who leads us into the new millennium on the road to One America. The three themes of education, service and One America already run through your record as President and in the years before that. They are three themes that people know run deep in you. They are your special trinity.
D0//			Now is the time, in an even fuller and stronger measure, to roll your efforts in these three vital areas into one commanding vision and one unified strategy. If you succeed, the whole will be recognized as far greater than the sum of the parts. The parts are not small, but so far most people fail to see how they come together in something very powerful and fundamental.
D0//			As of now, one might predict that historians will acknowledge you as a President who, with indomitable spirit, under unprecedented continuous assault, made progress in many increments on many different fronts. If that is all you did, it would be very good. But what I imagine, and more importantly what the spirit of the nation needs, is far more — that you speak and act in these next three years so you stand tall in history as the one who in the last half of this century ushered in a truly great transformation.
D0//			Roosevelt led such a transformation in the crucible of the Great Depression. Lincoln did it in the Civil War. You can do it in our more complicated time, even though, as you have noted, it is very difficult when there is not an inescapable, galvanizing crisis.
D0//			Yet, as you know, there is a quiet crisis of the American spirit — the civic spirit that made America great. There is the slow-burning crisis of American youth — especially for the 15 million or more who lack the fundamentals for success. There is the profound crisis of American unity — of the two cities of rich and poor, and the divisions of race.
D1//			To galvanize the country for action to deal with this compound crisis, I urge you to embrace the strategy we used to organize the Presidents’ Summit — which is now our strategy in the post-summit campaign for America’s Promise. That is, to focus on the key problems for children and youth and work to bring together all the forces of our society, including citizen service and government at all levels, to solve these problems. And to do it by embracing and giving priority to the measurable goals set at the summit, around which America’s Promise and our national service network are mobilizing people, state-by-state, and community-bycommunity.
D0//			The Five Summit Goals encompass the themes of good education for ail, citizen service for youth and service by all young people, and common work by young and old, across all the lines that divide us, to build One America. The Goals include a healthy start and access to health care for all children, which is also needed to make America one, and for which you have also done so much.
D0//			And the overarching vision is the one you have been articulating so well - One America. It is that vision which connects the three themes. Education is the great equalizer, but to achieve One America that succeeds in self-government, it must be education in the full sense, not just in the classroom and in training for jobs. It must also be education in citizenship, in the ethic and practice of citizen service.
D0//			Morally and strategically this focus on children and youth, on their education and on service to and by youth, is the right strategy for our time. It is a common ground on which people of common sense can rally for the common good.
D0//			When Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy were killed the goals set by the Summit were the ones they were pointing to. The nation has paid a terrible price in not achieving those goals for millions of young people who came of age in the last thirty years. If you use the Bully Pulpit of the Presidency, with all your extraordinary power of persuasion, you can make the next years the beginning of Civil Rights II.
D0//			In delivering his Dream on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, Martin said, “We have come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now.” And he spelled out our mission: “ Now is the time to open the doors of opportunity for all of God’s children.”
D0//			The Capitol is not so hallowed a spot, but the State of the Union is the right occasion to summon up the “better angels of our nature.”
D0//			You conveyed so well the essence and centrality of this vision and strategy in your from-the-heart, stirring words to the volunteers at Cardozo. You also articulated this clearly in your December interview with the New York Times, when you said your Race Initiative “needs to be seen in the context also of what I have tried to do since I got here on citizen service, the whole idea of AmeriCorps, participating in the Presidents’ Summit on Service, all that.” And your goal in a “larger sense,” you said is, “to create an ethic of service across racial lines so that when we begin this new century and when I leave office and go off into the sunset, the typical American will have at least three opportunities for constructive engagement with people of other races — one at work, one at school, and one in community service working on common problems. So I intend to try to work to sort of integrate all that.”
D0//			With the vision of One America and that strategy for education and service, and with your strong and sustained leadership, I believe you can yet bring this country together around the great, unifying national cause we need.
D1//			FYI, Maria Echaveste has been pushing for an 800 number for the state of the union where the President could refer people who want to volunteer, in connection with the race initiative. The Corporation for National Service told her it couldn't do this, particularly on such short notice, but suggested creating a Corp. web site that would point potential volunteers to existing web sites of the United Way, the big youth service group, United Way, America's Promise, etc. So we'll see. (Previously, Maria tried to get religious orgs to agree to offer service opportunities, but didn't get much response.)
D0//			| hear that Communications may push to do the radio address on MLK Day and service. Since we have the service project on Monday, that may be overkill, so I'm certainly not pushing it. But, if it becomes the best option, here are my best policy announcements {they're pretty small):
D0//			1. President's Youth Service Awards -- The Corporation i i h these; | sent you a note on this the other day. But the First Lady may be planning to announce this in her column, so we'd have to call that off.
D0//			2. AmeriCorps has a study it hasn't formally released on diversity in AmeriCorps. It's pretty boring -- qualitative stuff about who benefits from diversity and how to support diversity. More interesting is a PC how-to manual by the study authors with examples from successful service programs. The Corporation's conclusion from the study is that national service gives participants a greater respect for others. :
D0//			3. The Presidential Memorandum asking agencies to report on how they support employees to want to volunteer during the work day is about to go out.
D1//			"4. We could see if Harris is comfortable announcing a ""Saturdays of service"" program for AmeriCorps NCCC, similar to CityYear's Young Heroes, where AmeriCorps and JH students work together on Saturdays."
T0//			I think this is an easy call, but let me know asap if the following raises any red flags.
T0//			Harris sent a Dec. 31 memo to the President in which he says the Corporation will relaunch the President's Youth Service Awards. These awards are essentially a certificate similar to the Président's Physical Fitness Award, and would go to any youngster who could demonstrate that they completed 100 hours ice ina year (part of the summit's goal 5). There is no cost. The program has bipartisan support. But it was suspended in March 1994 after a negative IG report on how it was being administered.
D1//			Apparently Gomperts told Melanne about the idea, and my second-hand information is that she liked it very much and the First Lady is seriously considering mentioning it in this week's column, which has a deadline of Thursday. So if there are any problems, we should surface them now.
D1//			{The other obvious question is whether we should hold this for him to announce at the service event on MLK Day, but this doesn't seem so appeating, and it's not clear we want an announcement.)
D1//			Here's a draft memo on Harris's proposal to resume the Dail i i s. Let me know whether you want the memo to come from you, and whether you want to recommend an option -| know you've said you really don't care in the past. Steve Silverman would probably be willing to send the memo if you don't want to.
D1//			This draft identifies a middle ground option between resuming and not resuming the awards, which is resuming them but not linking them to the President. It's been hard to get closure on where people are on this issue, but I think Ann Lewis opposes it, while Steve Silverman thinks we should do something here. Harris says that the former President will be very disappointed if we reject this idea.
D0//			Background: Harris Wofford has written to urge that you resume former President Bush’s “ Daily Points of Light” awards. He proposes to rename the awards the “Presidents’ [plural] Points of Light,” with you and President Bush as co-sponsors. Rather than having the White House take responsibility for selecting and vetting the winners on a daily basis, as was the case under President Bush, Harris proposes that the Points of Light Foundation and the Corporation for National Service take on this responsibility. The Knights of Columbus have agreed to fund the costs of this program for one year.
D0//			One factor complicating the decision is that Harris has had extensive conversations with the Points of Light Foundation and with President Bush himself on this proposal. Apparently Harris has made it clear that he favors this idea and that the decision rests with the White House. Harris indicates that President Bush will be deeply disappointed if we decide not to resume the awards.
D0//			One other timing issue is that you are scheduled to attend the dedication of President Bush’s library in November. If we decide to reinstate this program, that event would be an opportunity to announce it, especially given the former President’s attachment to the Points of Light program.
D0//			Arguments For: Reinstating the awards is an easy way to keep the issue of service and volunteerism before the public on a daily basis. It would continue to repair the rift between the AmeriCorps concept of service and the more traditional volunteer sector, just as the Philadelphia summit did. AmeriCorps members would be eligible for the awards.
D0//			President Bush very much wants the Administration to do this. He will be very disappointed if we do not, and he will see it as the White House’s decision because of Harris’ conversations with him.
D0//			Arguments Against: The benefits of resuming the awards are minimal. Our efforts to reach out to the volunteer sector at the Philadelphia summit were so successful that it is not clear what this would add. In addition, some would react negatively to such a decision, since the original Points of Light program was derided by many as an empty gesture.
D0//			The daily responsibility of selecting and vetting winners will be time-consuming for White House staff, and not worth the effort. Although theoretically we could assign responsibility for vetting the award winners to the Points of Light Foundation and the Corporation for National Service, from a practical standpoint we would probably still feel the need to do a legal and/or political check on award winners.
D0//			Options: Resume the awards as Wofford proposes.
D0//			Decline to resume the awards.
D0//			Reestablish these awards as the “Daily Points of Light” awards, administered by the Corporation and the Points of Light Foundation, with no connection to the President or the White House. It is not clear how President Bush would react to such a plan.
D1//			Several members of the press are planning stories on progress in the 6 months since the service summit. The Times already did one, and the Boston Globe is working on one that may not be positive; it may already have been in the press this weekend. Jonathan Alter will do one that people suspect will be critical. America's Promise is trying to respond by putting together a 6-month update that Powell will reveal in some setting later this month. They have asked all commitment makers for media-oriented nuggets they could use. (I am putting together a package for them on federal agency commitments.} America's Promisé remains in a state of flux. They still have not developed their tracking system for commitments, and personnel changes continue.
D1//			"Steve Silverman and | have talked about us doing a ""6 month memo” that would lay out our own progress since the summit and talk about where we want to be at the 1-year point. Let me know if you think that's a good or bad idea. Ideas we could develop are outreach on health insurance both Medicaid and the new program; and reauthorization of AmeriCorps. You that  Harris just Sent the President a memo -- it's a general update on the Corporation, wit! making reauthorization a priority by releasing it this year and pushing hard early next year"
D1//			Folks--this issue has been kicking around and getting more momentum. VA has analyzed over the last few years the claims of these Filipinos for benefits as veterans having fought for the US in WWII. I believe the conclusion is that it would be extremely costly but | don't believe the White House has ever engaged in a substantive analysis of the merits of the claim other than the financial cost. | think we need a process to have this resolved--it has gotten on the President's radar screen. | would be happy to coordinate this process, if you'll assign the appropriate staff members for this work. Thank you.
D0//			PURPOSE To announce significant budget initiatives to help break the cycle of crime and drugs. A new Justice Department report, also released today, shows that in 1997 more than threequarters of the nation’s prisoners reported past drug use, more than half reported using drugs in the month before their offense, and one in six committed their crimes so they could purchase drugs. Responding to these findings, you will announce new resources to help states and localities systematically test, treat, and sanction drug-involved offenders -including $215 million in the FY 2000 budget to enforce “zero tolerance” for drug use by prisoners, parolees, and probationers.
D0//			BACKGROUND Today the Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics will release a new study on prisoner drug use (Substance Abuse and Treatment, State and Federal Prisoners, 1997). Key findings regarding prisoner drug use include:
D0//			Vast majority of all prisoners report drug use. In 1997, 83 percent of state prisoners and 73 percent of federal prisoners reported past drug use -considerably more than the 21 percent of state prisoners and 60 percent of federal prisoners who are serving time for drug offenses. In addition, 57 percent of state prisoners and 45 percent of federal prisoners reported using drugs in the month before their arrest.
D0//			Many prisoners commit crimes to buy drugs or while high. Nearly 20 percent of state prisoners and 15 percent of federal inmates reported committing their offense to get money to buy drugs. And 33 percent of state prisoners and 22 percent of federal prisoners were actually under the influence of drugs at the time of their offense.
D0//			Drug offenders have long “rap sheets.” State prisoners serving sentences for drug offenses reported extensive criminal histories: 76 percent had been previously sentenced to prison or probation; 54 percent were on probation or parole at the time of their arrest; 45 percent had three or more prior sentences, and 23 percent had previously committed a violent crime. Although federal drug offenders generally reported less severe criminal histories, 59 percent had prior criminal records.
D0//			You will announce new measures to ensure that the criminal justice system operates to keep offenders drug- and crime-free, including: (1) $215 million in your FY 2000 budget proposal to drug test and treat more people under criminal justice supervision; and (2) the availability of about $120 million in FY 1999 to help make prisoners and parolees drugfree.
D0//			(1) $215 million for the most comprehensive drug supervision ever. Your FY 2000 budget will include $100 million to help states and localities implement tough new systems to drug test, treat,and punish prisoners, parolees, and probationers. This initiative will ensure that states fully implement the comprehensive plans to drug test prisoners and parolees that they are required by law to submit to the Justice Department, while also supporting the efforts of states like Maryland and Connecticut to begin drug testing probationers on a regular basis. Your FY 2000 budget also will include $50 million -- or an increase of 25 percent -- to expand the number of local drug courts and $65 million for residential drug treatment in state prisons.
D0//			(2) About $120 million this year for drug-free prison initiatives. You will announce the availability or release of the following grants to ensure that states fully implement their comprehensive plans for prison drug testing, treatment, and sanctions:
D0//			-- Up to $50 million for prison drug testing and intervention. Today the Justice Department will release new guidance informing states that they can use up to 10 percent of their prison construction funds (Violent Offender Incarceration/Truth-in-Sentencing grants) to drug test and treat prisoners and parolees. Last year, you called on Congress to give the states this flexibility, and he fought for it to be included in the final budget agreement.
D0//			-- $63 million for residential drug treatment in state prisons. The Justice Department also will announce the availability of $63 million for state prisons to provide long-term drug treatment and intensive supervision for prisoners with the most serious drug problems.
D0//			-- $6 million for new Drug-Free Prison initiatives. You will announce that the Office of National Drug Control Policy will award $6 million in grants to help 8 states (AL, AZ, CA, FL, KS, MD, NJ, NY) and the Federal Bureau of Prisons make and keep their prisons drug-free. These grants will support surveillance systems, drug-sniffing K-9 teams, advanced technologies for drug detection, and other efforts to detect and deter drug use in prisons.
D0//			SEQUENCE OF EVENTS - YOU will be announced onto the stage accompanied by stage participants. - Director McCaffrey will make introductory remarks and introduce the Attorney General. - The Attorney General will make remarks and introduce the Lt. Governor. - The Lt. Governor will make remarks and introduce YOU. - YOU will make remarks and then depart.
D0//			REMARKS Provided by Speechwriting.
D0//			Q The Administration says that it has increased drug testing and treatment in the federal prisons, but the Justice Department report suggests a decrease in inmate treatment since 1991. How do you explain this contradiction?
D0//			We have definitely increased the number of federal inmates that are drug tested and treated. The 1994 Crime Act mandated that, by the end of FY 1997, all federal prisoners eligible for residential drug treatment should receive such treatment. As a result, by 1998, the Federal Bureau of Prisons was conducting about 30,000 more drug tests per year and providing residential drug treatment to four times as many prisoners. The number of inmates participating in other types of drug abuse and education programs also increased during this time.
D0//			However, these increases may not have kept pace with the rapid growth in the prison population during that same period. In fact, between 1991 and 1997, the federal prison population grew by well over 50 percent (from 71,000 to about 113,000). Thus, even while more treatment slots were being made available -- and more prisoners were participating in other drug abuse and education programs -- the overall percentage in treatment may have declined.
D0//			Finally, it should be noted that the Justice Department report includes a disclaimer saying that -- because the likelihood of receiving treatment increases as a prisoner’s release date approaches -- it may have underestimated the total number of prisoners who will ultimately receive drug treatment.
D0//			Q What will the overall increase in funding be for drug testing and treatment as a result of this new initiative?
D0//			The “zero tolerance” drug supervision initiative represents a funding enhancement of $112 million for FY 2000. This includes: $100 million in new funds for states and localities to drug test and treat prisoners, parolees, and probationers; an increase of $10 million for additional drug courts (from $40 to $50 million); and an increase of $2 million for the residential drug treatment in state prisons (from $63 million to $65 million).
D0//			You’ve talked about a “zero tolerance” policy for prisoners and drugs before, as well as requiring states to drug test and treat offenders. What is really new about today’s announcement?
D0//			Today’s announcement takes us a step further in accomplishing comprehensive testing and treatment for offenders in two significant ways. First, the President’s FY 2000 budget initiative proposes over $100 million in new, direct funds for states to carry out their own plans to test and treat prisoners and parolees. And second, these funds can be used, for the first time, to begin to test and treat the over 3 million adult probationers -- two-thirdsof which have serious substance abuse problems.
D0//			What is the average cost of a drug test?
D0//			The Federal Bureau of Prisons spends less than $9.00 per drug test for the nearly 130,000 drug tests it conducted last year. Costs can vary depending on the number of drugs tested for, procedural requirements, and the number of tests needed (lower quantities will cost more.
D0//			Is overall drug use increasing or decreasing? And how does it compare to the statistics contained in today’s report on prisoner drug use?
D0//			According to the most recent National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, there were 13.9 million current drug users in 1997 -- or about half the number of drug users during the peak year of 1979. These nearly 14 million drug users represent about 6 percent of the American population age 12 and older, and the number has remained roughly flat since 1992.
D0//			By comparison, current drug use by prisoners has increased since 1991 and ranges between 5 to 10 times greater than the overall population.
D0//			But isn’t youth drug use increasing?
D0//			Not according to the most recent study released by the Department of Health and Human Services. The 1998 Monitoring the Future Survey showed that for the second year in a row, youth drug use, in nearly every category, has either decreased or leveled off among 8th, 10th, and 12th graders. Specifically, marijuana use -- the most widely used drug by teens -- appears to have leveled off, with declines reported for the second year. Just as importantly, youth attitudes toward drugs appear to be turning around, with more young people viewing marijuana use as risky behavior.
D0//			So, while teen drug use remains unacceptably high -- and considerably higher than its low point in 1991 -- we are encouraged by these positive trends.
D0//			"Acknowledge:Atty. Gen. Reno, Gen. McCaffrey, Lt. Gov. Townsend. I want to thank her for pioneering a tough program of drug treatment and testing in her state. Reno Mayor Jeff Griffin, who chairs the Crime Committee at the United States Conference of Mayors. I thank the Mayor and the conference for their leadership; Reno Police Chief Jerry Hoover. Our special guests from Maryland, who have been leaders on these issues: Special Ass’t. Atty. General Francis William Mann; Del. Peter Franchot; Baltimore City Police Commisioner Thomas Fraiser; Baltimore Council Member Rochelle ""Rikki"" Spector."
D0//			Six years ago, America was at peace, but many of our communities were at war. Illegal drugs were ravaging cities on both coasts and in the American heartland in between. Crack and methamphetamine use were at near-epidemic levels. Drug dealers who controlled whole neighborhoods thought nothing of opening fire on passing police cars. Too many communities lived in terror. Too many children feared they would not live to march in their high school graduations.
D0//			I took office determined to give all those children back their futures and ail those communities back their peace of mind. In every successive year of my presidency, I have proposed and passed the largest anti-drug budget ever. Between 1996 and 1999 alone, we have increased funding for anti-drug efforts by more than 30% -- even as we produced the first balanced budget in a generation. And under the leadership of Gen. McCaffrey, we have put these resources to very good use: Unprecedented new tools for domestic law enforcement. Unprecedented new campaigns to convince young people that drugs kill. Unprecedented new efforts to stem the flow of drugs across our borders. Unprecedented new efforts to stop the revolving door between prison and the street, between drug use and criminal activity.
D0//			As you've heard from Gens. Reno and McCaffrey, our strategy is working. Not only do we have the lowest crime rates in 25 years. Overall drug use is falling. Even drug-use among young people is beginning to decline.
D0//			But now is not a time to rest. Now is the time to work harder than ever to build on these very encouraging trends. At this time of prosperity, we have the resources, the proven strategies, and the confidence to make this new year the best year ever for reducing drugs and crime.
D0//			I believe that there is no better way to meet this ambitious goal than to expand our efforts to force prisoners to make a clean break from drugs. Today, we are releasing a new study by the Department of Justice that offers even more convincing evidence that drug use stokes all types of crime, from property crimes like burglary and auto theft, to violent crimes like assault and murder. It shows that one in six offenders landed in prison for a crime he committed just to get money for drugs...that nearly a third of prisoners were using drugs at the time they committed their crimes...and that more than 80% of prisoners have a history of drug abuse. There is no question that if we are to continue reducing the rate of crime, we cannot afford to continue releasing criminals with their dangerous drug habits intact.
D0//			As you have heard from Gens. Reno and McCaffrey, we have already done much to expand drug-testing and treatment in federal prisons and to encourage states to do the same. But today, we will make a quantum leap forward. I am proud to announce that the balanced budget I will submit to Congress will contain a $215 million zero-tolerance drug-supervision initiative, our nation's most comprehensive effort ever to test and treat not only criminals in prison, but also those out on probation and parole. To inmates in every state we will say: If you stay on drugs, then you'll stay behind bars. And to probationers and parolees the message will be equally clear: If you want to keep your freedom, you have to keep free of drugs.
D0//			Through this initiative, we will also expand our efforts to help communities build and administer drug courts. As you have heard from Gen. Reno, drug courts are one of the most effective ways of making offenders give up both drugs and a life of crime. When I took office there were four drug courts in operation, including the one Gen. Reno launched in Miami. Today, there are more than 400. And if my budget proposal is approved by Congress, we can have more than a thousand up and running by the end of next year.
D0//			Iam also proud to announce that on top of these new budget proposals,we will free another $120 million for drug-free prison initiatives this year -- funds that will help states boost testing and treatment and purge their prisons of drugs with advanced new technologies.
D0//			In these final years of the 20th century, America has made tremendous progress in our efforts to free our children and our communities from the dangerous threat of drugs and crime. Now, as we begin a new century and a new millennium, we have a remarkable opportunity to harness all the resources of our criminal justice system -- our courts, prisons, prosecutors, probation officers, and police -- to break the drug habits of our prisoners, and break the cycle of drugs and crime for all time. Let us seize it. Thank you and God bless you.
D1//			"I've suggested to both MD and ONDCP that they should postpone their 12/9 ""Drug-Free Prisons"" event until the first week in January when we anticipate being able to do a broader coerced abstinence event with new guidance for the use of prison funds, a DOJ report on drug testing/treatment in prisons and ONDCP's drug detection grants. The ONDCP announcement -while not huge -- links nicely with the prison grants and would allow us to show -- exactly a year after the President signed a directive on ""zero tolerance” for drugs in prisons -- that we've made progress on 2 out of the 3 issues we identified at the time: (1) up to $50 million for the 50 states to do more testing and treatment; and (2) $4 million for 8 key states to implement drug detection technologies to keep drugs out of prisons (MD, CA, AZ, AL, FL, NJ, NY and KS). (FYI: The third issue was increased penalties, at the state level, for trafficking drugs into prisons.)"
D0//			Should we also have cabinet affairs or someone else reach out to McCaffrey's folks to make the same request?
D0//			In his radio address to the nation, the President will announce the findings of a Justice Department study showing that in 9 of 23 cities the number of arrestees who tested positive for drug use remained the same or decreased slightly from 1996. This includes New York, Chicago and Detroit - where cocaine use is declining, marijuana is leveling off, and methamphetamine (meth) is not a major substance of abuse.
D0//			Additionally, the President will announce: (1) $27 million in grants for more than 150 drug courts that use the full power of the criminal justice system to rid crime-committing addicts of their drug habits; and (2) the availibility of $5 million in grants for local law enforcement agencies to combat methamphetamine trafficking.
D0//			Drug Use by Arrestees . Cocaine use decreasing. Cocaine use continues to decline, most dramatically in the West and Northeast -- where use had reached epidemic levels (80% and more) in the late 1980's -- and among younger arrestees. In Detroit and Washington, D.C., only 5% of young adult arrestees tested positive for cocaine, while nearly half of all older arrestees tested positive for that drug.
D0//			. Marijuana use leveling off. After increasing over the past several years, marijuana use by younger arrestees is leveling off. Fifteen of the 23 sites reported drops in marijuana use by younger arrestees -- including substantial drops in Houston, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Omaha, Phoenix, and Washington, D.C.
D0//			. Methamphetamine use rebounds. Meth, which is almost completely absent outside of the West and Southwest, increased in San Diego, Phoenix, San Jose, Portland (OR), Omaha, Dallas and Denver. Previously, meth use had declined over the past 2 years in these cities.
D0//			. New heroin problem in some cities. Although heroin abuse remains relatively constant and concentrated among older arrestees, this is not true in New Orleans, Philadelphia and St. Louis. Younger arrestees are more likely to test positive for heroin in these 3 cities.
D0//			. The Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Program (ADAM). ADAM is conducted by the Department of Justice’s National Institute of Justice (NIJ) and provides drug use trends as well as a critical local perspective to the national drug problem. ADAM data is obtained through drug tests and interviews with a population of arrestees. In 1997, ADAM collected data in 23 major metropolitan sites from 19,736 adult males, 7,547 adult females at 21 sites, 3,686 juvenile males in 12 sites and 647 juvenile girl detainees in 8 sites. To continue to help communities respond to local drug problems, the Administration plans to expand ADAM to a total of 35 cities this year and even more in coming years.
D0//			President Clinton: A National Policy on Coerced Abstinence . Expanding drug courts nationwide. Today, the Justice Department will provide $27 million in drug court funding for more than 150 jurisdictions to plan, implement, or enhance new and existing drug courts.
D0//			Leading the national drug court effort. Since the creation of President Clinton’s drug court initiative in the 1994 Crime Act, the number of drug courts has grown exponentially. According to the National Association of Drug Court Professionals, the number of drug courts has increased from 12 in 1994 to more than 400 today. And by the year 2000, it is estimated that there will be more than 1,000 drug courts throughout the country.
D0//			Rigorous testing and sanctions. A recent study by Columbia University’s National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) concluded that drug courts provide more frequent drug testing, and closer supervision than other forms of community supervision. In fact, 55% of drug courts test offenders at least twice weekly, and 35% test offenders at least every week.
D0//			Keeping offenders drug- and crime-free. The CASA study also found that drug use and criminal behavior were substantially reduced while offenders were under drug court supervision, as well as after leaving the program. For example, only 4% of the drug court participants in Jackson Country, MO, were rearrested -- as compared to 13% of those ina control group. And even after leaving the program, drug court participants -- even if they don’t complete the program -- recidivate at rates 4-20% lower than those in control groups.
D0//			Challenging Congress to promote coerced abstinence, This past year, two states -Connecticut and Maryland -- adopted statewide policies of coerced abstinence, and the President challenged Congress to follow their lead by passing his $85 million drug testing and intervention initiative. This initiative will allow states and localities to test and treat probationers, prisoners and parolees.
D0//			A strong record promoting coerced abstinence. President Clinton has consistently promoted a policy of drug testing, sanctions, and treatment for drug offenders. He has required states to drug test prisoners and parolees as a condition for receiving prison grants; called for drug testing of federal criminal defendants; expanded testing and treatment in federal prisons; and proposed allowing states to use federal prison funds for drug detection, testing and treatment.
D0//			Halting the Spread of Methamphetamine Using community policing to combat meth. Justice’s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) will make nearly $5 million available to jurisdictions with a documented meth problem. Funds can be used for meth enforcement, intervention, and prevention. The 6 participating cities are: Phoenix, AZ; Salt Lake City, UT; Oklahoma City, OK; Dallas, TX; Little Rock, AR; and Minneapolis, MN.
D0//			An ongoing strategy on methamphetamine. The President fought for and signed a comprehensive meth strategy that increases penalties for trafficking in meth, and toughens the penalties for trafficking in the precursor chemicals used in its production. Meth enforcement remains a top law enforcement priority, and the President’s Drug Strategy and Budget call for $24.5 million to hire 100 new DEA agents to target meth trafficking.
D0//			The report on jail inmates released today by the Justice Department confirms the urgent need for government at all levels to pursue a policy of coerced abstinence for drug offenders. The report shows that more than half of these criminals used drugs in the month prior to their arrest. We have an obligation to install a tough system of testing, treatment and punishment for drug offenders to prevent them from returning to the streets with dangerous drug habits intact. Congress can take the lead by adopting my Administration’s proposals to promote coerced abstinence throughout the criminal justice system.
D1//			Mary had an idea for an event on heroin and the fashion industry: in the wake of the President blasting them on heroin-chic ads, the industry put together a council to reform themselves, we thought we should publicize their response. You guys kind of liked the idea.
D1//			Now there is a report coming out that will show heroin use is up. Mary sent the event idea to Rahm who liked it (dovetailing with the report) and suggested DPC put together a scheduling request.
D1//			We're sending the memo over to Jjose/Leanne for figuring out if this is a good idea. Options include having the fashion/entertainmenj/people come to the WH to talk about reforming the images they use, a PSA campaign, etc.
