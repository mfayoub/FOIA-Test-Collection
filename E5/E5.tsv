E0			CAMPAIGN    PovToBACCo-fREE icAs
E0			August 7, 1998
E0			General Barry R. Mccaffrey Director Office of National Drug Control Policy 750- 17th Street, NW Washington, DC 20006
E0			Dear General McCaffrey:
E0			As we have stated previously, we are enthused and heartened by your National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign. Your careful planning, support from Congress, the media, the business community and many others are strong indications that this campaign will be a success in curbing illegal drug use among our nation's children. In addition , we hope it will be a precedent and a model for a national counter-marketing program against youth tobacco use.
E0			However, there is one aspect of your Campaign that concerns us greatly. We understand that the Bates USA advertising agency is handling the media planning and buying for Phase II of the program and is in contention to be awarded Phase Ill - the full roll out of the entire Campaign activities.
E0			"This is most unfortunate. Bates 'USA is an advertising agency that is a key partner of the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, and handles: Capri, a cigarette marketed to women; Kool, a menthol cigarette backed by a new campaign with seductive imagery - ""B Kool"" - aimed at attracting a younger audience; and Lucky Strike, which is featured in a cover story in this week's Advertising Age (see attached) in which a Bates executive discusses ""marketing strategies to reach the target audience of young adults through underground and lifestyle channels."""
E0			"As you will note in the attached article from the New York Times, Bates has strengthened its position in the Brown & Williamson roster of advertising agencies and ""handles so-called premium brands and Grey the so-called value brands."""
E0			Awarding Bates your valued contract would send a very negative message:
E0			"    • It would be a conflict of interest , in that Bates could not be expected to do its best in media negotiations and buys in which the ""matching"" time and space they acquire could be used for anti-tobacco messages,  thus working against their Brown & Williamson client. Indeed , it is possible that Brown and Williamson would not allow Bates to engage in media strategies that are truly effective. The tobacco industry has a history of threatening and punish ing vendors, including advertising agencies, that engage in activities to which the industry objects."

E0			    • It would raise questions about the credibility of the program. For years the tobacco industry has claimed that they don't market to kids.  On a number of occasions  they have promoted campaigns that they claimed were designed to discourage tobacco use among children. However, independent experts who have studied these campaigns have always concluded that the campaigns were ineffective and were public relations ploys designed to get Congress off the tobacco industry's back, and not to reduce tobacco use.
E0			    • It would say to Madison Avenue and the business community at large that it is perfectly fine -in fact it is rewarding - to handle tobacco marketing and advertising, which has been shown to attract children to begin smoking as well as the selection of the brands they smoke, and at the same time be given important government anti-drug business. This is most assuredly not the message that should be sent.
E0			    • It would be extremely discouraging to the public health and_tobacco control community, which is fighting against the tobacco industry and its billions of dollars in marketing, legal, lobbying, political contributions and special interest politics.
E0			And finally, General Mccaffrey, awarding Bates your business would be a potential embarrassment to the Clinton Administration and those many members  of Congress who have taken a very strong position against tobacco marketing to children and in favor of comprehensive tobacco control legislation, including curbs on marketing practices that influence children to smoke and use spit tobacco.
E0			The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and its many partners are watching your National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign with great interest and hope. Please do not disappoint us by bringing into your team an ad agency that is working effectively for Big Tobacco, and as such represents a threat to America's children.
E0			We would be pleased to discuss this with you or members of your staff. We look forward to a continuing partnership in reducing drug use in America, including tobacco, which is illegal for children.

E0			Excerpts from May 14, 1997 statement by General Barry McCaffrey, before the Senate Appropriations Committee, Subcommittee on Treasury, General Government and Civil Service
E0			Comments about the $175 Million Youth-Oriented Anti-Drug Campaign.
E0			        ◦ Drug use has gone up among America's  youth during the p_ast  five years.  The principal reasons that more of our children are using drugs is that fewer of them disapprove of illegal drug use and fewer perceive regular drug use as dangerous. The University of Michigan's Monito,:ing the Future Study makes clear this association between attitudes and usage rates.
E0			        ◦ Unfortunately, in recent years the number of drug-related public service announcements (PSAs) carried by television, radio and print media have decreased markedly. The economics of the media industr-y have made advertising space so competitive that pro-bono advertising has dropped more than 30 percent in recent years. Even worse, virtually no PSAs appear in prime-time.
E0			        ◦ We seek to reverse this trend by developing a public education campaign that supplements anti-drug announcements already offered by dedicated organizations like the Partnership for a Drug-Free America under Jim Burke's leadership and the Ad Council.
E0			        ◦ The President's FY 1998 budget seeks to fund this targeted educational campaign through the $175 million provided in ONDCP's Special Forfeiture Fund. ONDCP will also seek matching private sector donations. The campaign will use both paid and public service television announcements to inform youth and their parents of the consequences of drug use.
E0			"        ◦ Targeted TV ads are among the quickest, most efficient and effective means of reducing drug use. They can modify adolescent perception of drug harmfulness and increase societal disapproval of drugs. They can also reach ""baby boomer"" parents who may be ambivalent about sending strong antidrug messages to their children."
E0			        ◦ Attitudes can be changed with accurate and convincing messages. ONDCP believes this campaign can help to reduce youth drug use dramatically.

E0			PULSE CHECK:    Special Report
E0			Methamphetamine Trends in Five Western States and Hawaii
E0			Executive Office of the President Office of National Drug Control Policy Barry R. McCaffrey, Director Office of Programs, Budget, Research, and Evaluation For Distribution Summer 1997
E0			 Introduction
E0			Methamphetamine, a powerful central nervous system stimulant, has been  part of  the drug culture for .many years. It was developed early  in this century  from its parent drug amphetamine  and was originally used in nasal decongestants, bronchial inhalers, and in the treatment of narcolepsy and obesity. Legally produced by pharmaceutical houses, amphetamine and methamphetamine were widely available in the 1950s and  '60s through  prescriptions as well as from a booming  black  market.  The Food and Drug Administration estimated in 1962 that over 8 billion tablets were legally produced each year with as much as half of that production going  to unauthorized  users.1  In the 1970s methamphetamine became a Schedule II drug; that is, a drug with little medical use and a high potential for abuse.
E0			"Almost from their first appearance, amphetamine and methamphetamine were abused.  Valued for the ability to keep a user awake for long periods of time and producing a false sense of energy and enhanced physical and mental performance, these drugs were used in the 1950s and early 1960s among groups such as srudents, long distance truckers,  and sports  figures.  In addition  to the tablet  form,  in the late 1960s methamphetamine in crystal or liquid form suitable for injection became popular and the terms ""crystal,"" ""speed"" and ""speed freak"" became part of the drug vernacular."
E0			Increased  Federal  regulation of these drugs produced  important changes in their availability, and the 1970s saw a marked decline  in their use.  Often,  what was sold on the street as methamphetamine was acrually another stimulant  like caffeine or ephedrine.  Illegal dealers began  to rely on domestic illegal laboratories to manufacture supplies for distribution. Highly dangerous, both because of the highly volatile chemicals used in the manufacturing process and the high potential for explosions and fire, methamphetamine production  and distribution  in the 1970s came to be dominated by outlaw motorcycle gangs operating out of mobile clandestine operations in the California and the Pacific Northwest. Methamphetamine use declined nationwide throughout the 1970s, concentrated in a few cities or regions. However, beginning in the late 1980s it appeared to be spreading  from these isolated areas to other new markets and gaining popularity among a larger number of users.
E0			"Methamphetamine is a unique drug.   In its conventional form, it can be snorted, injected  or even eaten. It can also be processed into a potent smokeable form known as ""ice,"" which, starting in Hawaii, gained popularity  in recent years in other areas.  Methamphetamine is both domestically produced and imported into the U.S. in already processed form. Once dominated by local producers in remote areas of California and the Northwest, the market now includes both locals and, increasingly, Mexican sources providing finished product to stateside distributors. For the local producers the processing required to make methamphetamine from precursor  substances  is not only easier  than  it once was, but also more accessible. There are literally thousands of recipes and discussions concerning how to make batches of methainphetamine on the Internet. These entries range from fairly simplistic recipes to highly technical and detailed instructions written by experts."
E0			1 For a complete discussion of the history of amphetamine use see Grinspoon and Hedblom The Speed Culture: Amphetamine Use and Abuse in America, Cambridge MA., Harvard University Press, 1975.
E0			Since its first publication in I992, the Pulse Check has reported  the rise in methamphetamine use in the West and Southwest and the increasing mention of its use in other parts of the country. This special edition of the ONDCP Pulse Check looks at methamphetamine use in six States-New Mexico, Arizona, California, Washington, Oregon and  Hawaii-those  States which appear  to be the hardest  hit by the reappearance of methamphetamine.
E0			For this report, a random sample of treatment providers from the National Drug  Abuse Treatment Unit Survey was taken, and a brief telephone interview with them conducted during the third and fourth weeks of December 1996. A total of 115 treatment providers were interviewed. The geographic distribution of those providers is illustrated in Figure I. In addition; drug ethnographers, researchers and law enforcement  officials in each State  were interviewed.  These sources are listed  in the Appendix. The interview covers topics such as: who is using the drug; how is it used; what other drugs dominate the area; the price of methamphetamine; how is the drug manufactured and sold.
E0			Each State has a unique experience with the re-emergence of methamphetamine. In the sections which follow, we summarize the results of the study by State.
E0			 CALIFORNIA
E0			      For many years methamphetamine abuse was highly localized in specific areas of California, notably San Francisco and San Diego County. In 1990 reports to the Community Epidemiology Work Group, methamphetamine was the most commonly abused drug in the population of persons entering treatment in San Diego. According to the San Diego researcher, in 1996, 45 percent of treatment admissions were due to methamphetamine. In addition, in 1995 arrestees in San Diego represented proportionately more methamphetamine users than at any other Drug Use Forecasting  (DUF) site.  In San Francisco over the past five years, methamphetamine has been consistently  the third  most commonly abused drug of clients admitted to treatment (behind heroin and cocaine) in the five counties that make up San Francisco; much of the abuse in the past was concentrated among the male gay community.   Increases  in other areas and among  a wider spectrum of users has continued  to the present. For example, Los Angeles, not associated with methamphetamine abuse in the past, currently reports that methamphetamine ranks second after cocaine as the primary drug of abuse at admission to treatment and is second nationwide in the number of emergency room mentions related to methamphetamine.
E0			Methamphetamine use in California is still concentrated in some areas, though surveys of treatment providers show a far wider dispersion of the drug's reach than ever before. The mode of ingestion (snorting and smoking versus injection) and the level of involvement of non-local manufacturers and distributors also differs significantly from the northern to the southern parts of the State .
E0			The prevalence of methamphetamine  reported  by all California  sources  reached  for this report is consistent with recent DAWN data which places San Diego, San Francisco,  and  Los Angeles  in the top five cities nationwide in emergency room  mentions  for methamphetamine in 1995.  These  three cities also lead the nation in the number of medical examiner repons (deaths) related  to methamphetamine. There are interesting differences in route of administration reflected in DAWN data between these cities.2 In San Francisco almost two-thirds of the methamphetamine mentions involve injection, whereas in the other two cities only I0-12 percent of mentions involve injection.
E0			"Ethnographic and epidemiologic sources in Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco substantiate the DAWN repons. In San Francisco, ethnographic sources report that methamphetamine, while once most popular in the gay community, is now increasingly used by blue collar workers, young professionals, and college students. Puning methamphetamine into coffee in what is tenned ""biker's coffe. e"" is reported as popular among young profess.ionals interested  in the drug's energizing and appetite suppressant effects, but not interested in snorting or injecting the drug. There are repons that in some segments of the gay community use of methamphetamine is related to ""marathon sex,"" often unprotected, where the drug allows the user to stay awake for long stretches of time. As the DAWN data indicate, in this area it is often injected, doubling the risk of transmission of blood borne viruses and sexually transmitted diseases. 2 These data should be interpreted with caution as they have problerrts due to large numbers of unspecified answers."
E0			" With the wider variety of users now evident, there is also a wider variety of sellers and distributors. While supplies had previously been part of a ""close distribution  network""  when motorcycle clubs dominated production, there are now different kinds of distributors targeting each of the user populations (college students, young professionals, blue collar workers, and the gay and club communities)."
E0			. In Southern California, methamphetamine continues  to be the  number  one or  two drug problem. DUF data indicate that after a slight drop in the number of arrestees testing positive for methamphetamine in San Diego in I995, use rose again in I996, particularly among women  and juveniles. In August 1996, 41 percent of women arrested tested positive for methamphetamine. In September 1995, 5 percent of juvenile male arrestees tested positive for methamphetamine. By September I996 that number had more than doubled to 13 percent. There is also increasing use among Hispanics in this area.
E0			". Methamphetamine in the San Diego area comes from two sources: some ""Mom and Pop"" operations out in rural areas of the county and, more commonly, from Mexican nationals bringing already manufactured methamphetamine across the border. The drug is typically sold in l /4 gram ($20-25), gram ($50-75) and 1/8 ounce ($140-180) units though larger amounts are available. In this area, sources estimate that less than IO percent of users inject, most preferring snorting or smoking the drug."
E0			. Methamphetamine appears to be second only to crack cocaine in popularity in the Los Angeles area. As in San Diego, there is a growing use among Hispanics, though the majority of users are white males. Methamphetamine is available from individual, local manufacturers  in inland  areas like Riverside, but the market is increasingly dominated by established Mexican Nationals with more efficient,  well-organized distribution  routes.  In Los Angeles,  methamphetamine is most often smoked or snorted rather than injected.
E0			. Treatment providers from across the State uniformly report that methamphetamine  is one of their most serious problems.  Treatment  admissions  in  1995 for  methamphetamine abuse San Francisco,  for example,  were double  the 1992 level.   In our survey of providers, 57 percent of  programs report that it is continuing to rise in their area; 25 percent feel that it has stabilized  and 7 percent report it declining. While methamphetamine is a commonly reported drug, it may not be the primary drug problem which brings their clients to treatment. 39 percent of programs  report alcohol as the most common problem among clients at entry into treatment, followed by opiates (18%), methamphetamine (18%), cocaine (14%) and marijuana (11%). However, on average 38 percent of treatment admissions are abusers of methamphetamine. Some programs, like one Northern California adolescent program, report far higher figures: 50 percent of the adolescent clients enter with methamphetamine as their primary drug of abuse and 80 percent report that they regularly use it.
E0			. Who is using methamphetamine? There are two basic profiles of users reported by treatment providers: I) students, both high school and college age, males and females, and 2) white, blue collar workers or unemployed persons in their twenties.
E0			 Several providers in Southern California also mention an increase in the number of Hispanic methamphetamine users, though whites still appear  to dominate this user group.  They are also likely to be users of alcohol and marijuana along with methamphetamine rather than users of drugs like heroin.
E0			For example, two methadone  programs  reported  that less than  10 percent of their clients enter treatment reporting that they use methamphetamine. In contrast, programs where alcohol or marijuana are the primary drugs of abuse at entry report that as many as 70-80 percent of their clients also use methamphetamine. 61 percent of treatment providers also felt that there was some substirution of methamphetamine for the less accessible and more expensive cocaine, but many also noted that methamphetamine has a clear following of its own.
E0			What prompts methamphetamine users to enter treatment?  Methamphetamine can cause a variety of mental, physical, and social problems which may prompt entry into treatment.  Though  it is not as expensive as heroin or cocaine, its cost might also produce financial problems for users and prompt them to seek help. Because so many clients in treatment for methamphetamine abuse are also unemployed, one might assume that it could eventually  produce difficulties on the job.  It is interesting to note, however, that the most commonly reported reason methamphetamine clients enter treatment is trouble with the law. 46 percent of programs  report that legal problems are the most common  reasons for entry; 29 percent report mental or emotional problems most common and  14 percent  report problems on the job or at school.
E0			". Several providers also describe methamphetamine abusers as ""the.hardest to treat."" They are often overly excitable and ""extremely resistant to any form of intervention once the acute effects of meth use have gone away,"" e.g., malnourishment, depression, chronic sleeplessness, headaches."
E0			WASHINGTON STATE
E0			. For the information concerning methamphetamine in Washington State, two law enforcement officials, a drug researcher at the University of Washington, and a random sample of 16 treatment providers around the State were interviewed.
E0			. In addition, we reviewed  1995 DAWN data, available only for Seattle.  DAWN data indicate a 7 percent increase from 1994-1995 in the number of medical examiner mentions for Seattle, about 4 . percent of all ME deaths reported for 1995. Of the 10,729 ER mentions for Seattle in 1995, approximately 3 percent involved methamphetamine.
E0			 All sources describe a rising trend in methamphetamine availability and use, though problems with heroin and cocaine are still dominant in the urban areas of the State. Epidemiologic data indicate that there has been a 252 percent increase in the number of treatment admissions  with methamphetamine as the primary drug of abuse between 1992 and 1995.  The overwhelming  majority of methamphetamine admissions are of whites (almost 90%); 40 percent are in their late twenties and early thirties and 37 percent are injecting the drug.
E0			 Epidemiologic sources point out that while the majority of users continues to be rural bikers and blue collar workers, there are also a number of other  groups now using.  For example,  it is reported that the drug is becoming increasingly popular among street youth, among Native American populations and among Hispanic immigrants. This source describes this as a diffusion from rural to urban, from gay populations to heterosexuals and from white to minorities.
E0			" Sellers and manufacturers in Washington State, including both local residents and Mexican Nationals, are reported to be increasing in number. One Seattle law enforcement source describes the increase in distribution and use as ""remarkable in the last 18 months."" The increase in the number of prosecutions from seven in 1991 to 52 in 1995 indicate the growth in the sheer number of dealers."
E0			"Labs are reported as springing up in a variety of places: hotels, motels, backrooms of other facilities. DEA sources report that, as in California, Mexican meth dealers are using the same routes and distributors for meth as they use or have used for heroin and cocaine. This source also reports the practice of ""eating"" meth; that is, putting it on paper or food and chewing it, though injecting and snorting are the most common modes of ingestion."
E0			 Among treatment providers interviewed around the State, 94 percent reported that methamphetamine use is increasing in their area. The remaining 6 percent report that it has stabilized. Though no programs reported that methamphetamine use  was the primary drug of abuse for most of their clients at treatment entry, on average,  approximately  30 percent of those  in treatment use the drug. As is reported in California, the most common reason cited for meth  using clients to seek treatment is trouble with the law (50%), followed by mental and family problems.
E0			" There is a wider variety of methods of using methamphetamine in the Washington area than in some of the other States. Providers report  that clients are equally  likely  to smoke,  inject, or  snort it. 81 percent of Washington treatment providers also reported that methamphetamine is substituting  for the more expensive and far less accessible cocaine. Almost 70 percent reported that use is up because methamphetamine is cheap and/or readily available throughout the State. Methamphetamine, like marijuana, is considered a ""local"" or ""homemade"" drug."
E0			" Who is using meth in Washington State? The typical user is described as white, high school educated, in his or her twenties and  thirties, and a blue collar or service  worker.  Several  providers stress that this is not someone who also uses heroin and cocaine. Two directors of Seattle  programs which serve  heroin  users state that less than 5  percent of  their clients use methamphetamine.  Most often the companion  drugs used  by  methamphetamine users are alcohol and  marijuana.  As one provider comments, ""It is the alcohol that brings them in here. Once in treatment, we see the problems with speed, pot, and hallucinogens."""
E0			OREGON
E0			" All sources describe methamphetamine as a ""continuing problem"" in Oregon. Methamphetamine has been part of the drug scene there since the !960s-a part that did not disappear completely as it did in many other areas of the country. Oregon has also been one of the States with steady activity in the production of methamphetamine and distribution to other areas of the West. Whereas other States may report only a handful of laboratory busts or supply seizures over the last twenty years, Oregon law enforcement reports consistent activity surrounding the drug."
E0			 DAWN data from medical examiners in Portland indicates a decline in deaths due to methamphetamine from 1994-1995. Similarly, data gathered from police sources in Eugene, regional DEA agents and treatment providers indicates that, while there may be some stabilization, methamphetamine use is still a major drug problem in the State.
E0			" Law enforcement sources report that methamphetamine continues to plague the area. July of 1995 brought one of the largest laboratory busts in an area of rural Oregon where manufacrurers were producing as much as 100 pounds of methamphetamine per batch. This bust led to related police action involving distributors across the Canadian border. While a portion of the drug is still produced locally, police sources report that currently the bulk of the supply now comes from California and Mexico. Production of methamphetamine is described as having ""always been around"" in rural Oregon. However, it is now no longer just a local operation managed by a handful of producers in small labs."
E0			" Treatment providers throughout the State describe methamphetamine as a problem. 47 percent of those interviewed reported that methamphetamine is the primary drug of abuse of their clients, followed by 40 percent reporting alcohol and 13 percent reporting marijuana as the primary problem. A average of 52 percent of clients across all programs use methamphetamine. In one small rural Oregon town, the treatment director commented that these are areas where ""people don't use cocaine-wouldn't think of it-but speed is widely accepted, particularly among 18-25 year  olds."" Another program which dealt only with adolescents reports that only 10 percent come into treatment with meth as the primary problem (that is usually alcohol or marijuana), but 70-80 percent use it. Many providers also commented on its availability due to ""homemade"" sources. 80 percent of providers reported the prevalence of meth in their area as due primarily to its low cost and/or wide availability."
E0			 Who is using meth in Oregon? The typical Oregon user is quite similar to that reported in other States: white, often. male, a blue collar worker now unemployed, in his/her rwenties and early thirties. Adolescent programs also report methamphetamine use among srudents, sometimes. as young as ninth graders.  The most common  reason for treatment entry  is legal troubles.  The most common method of ingestion in this area is snorting, followed by injecting and, to a far lesser degree, smoking.
E0			ARIZONA
E0			".  Like Southern California, Arizona has reported problems with methamphetamine use and trafficking for several years. Sitting at the southwest border, Arizona has been struggling with the traffic in what one source described as ""first the makings for the cake (chemicals) and now the cake itself (processed methamphetamine)"" for many years."
E0			. DAWN data indicate that Phoenix ranks third nationwide in the number of methamphetamine  ER mentions in 1995 with 732 mentions, about 10 percent of all Phoenix ER mentions, though this number has been decreasing over the last few years. Medical examiner data from Phoenix is also somewhat encouraging, indicating a substantial decline (29%) in the number of deaths attributable to methamphetamine. Approximately 42 percent of these mentions involve smoking of the drug, the most common method reported in the State by all sources.
E0			". Ethnographic sources report that methamphetamine in both urban and rural areas is a widely prevalent, and may be increasingly popular among young users where ""it has not received the attention cocaine has; does not have the 'mystique' cocaine  has.""  Users tend  to be either  White,  rural  blue collar workers who have used the drug for many years or urban cocaine users who are switching to methamphetamine. The latter users are described as people who can not get cocaine and/or those who burn out on the drug and ""need the stronger, longer lasting and cheaper high meth can provide."" The problem noted by this source is that users burn out even faster often developing even higher levels of paranoia or other dysfunctional behavior than they experience with cocaine."
E0			". Law enforcement sources in Phoenix report that methamphetamine continues as the ""drug of choice"" in Arizona,  the number one street  trafficking  drug problem.  Though  this source describes adult use as stabilizing somewhat, like the ethnographic source,  he feels that adolescent  use appears to be increasing as adolescents ""feel more confident of its safety,"" perceiving it safer than cocaine. These users are more likely to snort the drug, though some are injecting."
E0			 Street level trade in methamphetamine is brisk in Phoenix. Prices range from $20-$25 for a 1/4 gram unit to $160-$180 for 1/8 ounce.  Sellers tend  to be U.S. citizens selling  their own  local  product or Mexican nationals selling  methamphetamine produced  across the border.  Many  local labs continue to spring up in the area and it is estimated that police uncover one or even two a week.
E0			 Of the 24 Arizona treatment providers interviewed, 71 percent felt that methamphetamine use was up in their area, overwhelmingly (72%) because it is cheap and/or available. While alcohol (46%) and cocaine (17%) are the primary drugs of abuse at entry in most programs, methamphetamine (13%) ranks third. In addition, these programs report an average of 40 percent of their clientele using methamphetamine at entry. Smoking and snorting the drug are most common routes of administration.
E0			 As in other States, providers in Arizona report troubles with  the law (63%) as the most common catalyst to treatment entry, followed by family problems (21%) and financial problems (8%). Most of the clients they see who are abusing methamphetamine are young (twenties) and either unemployed or employed in a blue collar occupation. While the typical user is still currently white, several providers noted the increase in methamphetamine abuse among young Hispanics and Native American populations. Urban areas like Phoenix and Tucson also reported the popularity of methamphetamine among the gay population due its image as an enhancer of sexual stamina.
E0			NEW MEXICO
E0			"Law enforcement sources in New Mexico report that methamphetamine is readily available in that State, both from heavy trafficking across the border and from the local operations which spring up, particularly in rural or remote areas. Though  there are many  ""match  book"" or  ""do-it-yourself' operations in the area, the bulk of the supplies to New Mexico come from the larger and more efficient Mexican based  producers.  The number of seizures of methamphetamine has increased dramatically since the early 1990s, including an almost 700 pound seizure in New Mexico in 1994."
E0			"The demand is both the traditional older  ""biker""  users as well as former cocaine and crack users switching to the cheaper, longer lasting high. When cocaine is available,  it is preferred  by many of these users.  This source reports that in fact, many  users buy  methamphetamine marketed  as cocaine."
E0			Half of the 16 treatment providers interviewed  report  that  metharnphetamine  use has increased in the past year, while 44 percent report that it has stabilized  in their areas.  Three-fourths of the programs report that the primary drug of abuse at entry for most of their clients is alcohol, followed by opiates (13%). No program  reported  that the majority of their clients  report  methamphetamine as the primary drug problem, and the average proportion of clients using meth at entry is 27 percent.
E0			"Several providers report that the stabilization in use is due to crackdowns on local labs in their area as well as a rise in the popularity of heroin in the State. Methamphetamine is described as widely available, however. As one provider commented, ""They think they won't become addicted and it is cheaper than anything but pot."" Programs in remote or very rural areas of the State often report users who value the drug for its ability  to keep them  working on farms or in oil fields for long  periods of time allowing them to accumulate extra or overtime pay. Too often, that pay is spent on the common companion or primary drug problem, alcohol."
E0			The typical users in New Mexico are white, unemployed, and in their twenties. They are as likely to snort the drug as they are to inject it. As in the other States, the most common reason for seeking treatment among meth abusers is trouble with the law. One provider describes a  male client who abuses alcohol and methamphetamine and routinely gets into brawls as a result. The aggression produced by inebriation, heightened by the paranoia and sense of physical prowess produced by methamphetamine, combine to make him a regular with the local authorities. Methamphetamine also, however, makes him a difficult arrestee to manage in small facilities.
E0			HAWAII
E0			"Sources in Hawaii report the greatest prevalence of methamphetamine use and the widest  range in types of  users of all the States surveyed.  Most often  in  the smokeable crystalline  form called  ""ice"" in the mainland but a number of other names in Hawaii, methamphetamine is reported among whites, Asians, males and females, srudents, blue collar workers, and professionals. It is smoked in expensive glass pipes, mixed with tobacco, or even in pipes made from soda cans."
E0			Drug research sources in Honolulu report that while methamphetamine has wide appeal in that area, it is also associated with violent episodes and difficulty in successful treatment. In a srudy in the early 1990s, 40 percent of prisoners admitted to local facilities had used methamphetamine. Sources of  the drug are both local and from other areas in the Pacific, though the drug is distributed and readily available through local dealers of other drugs like cocaine and heroin.
E0			"69 percent of treatment providers interviewed felt that methamphetami""ne use had increased over the past year and 25 percent felt it was stabilizing. It is the primary drug of abuse at entry for 38 percent of programs interviewed, second only to alcohol (44%) and followed by marijuana (19%). An average of 55 percent of the clients at entry use methamphetamine, and, as in other States, it is trouble with the law which prompts them to seek treatment most of the time (44%). Several providers receive clients through employee assistance programs which refer employees who have exhibited inappropriate or aggressive behavior on the job or chronic absenteeism."
E0			"The typical user profile is harder to draw for Hawaii. While many programs  report that users  are young (teens and twenties), there is a range of jobs, ethnicities, and education levels reported. No program reports that clients inject; users either smoke methamphetamine (81 %) or inhale it (25%). A commonly reported problem in treating these clients is that they ""rarely admit to methamphetamine abuse. They will tell you about ""huffing"" (inhalant abuse) if they are kids or about alcohol if they are adults, but fail to mention the meth until Yllll ask them."" Methamphetamine users do, however, need extended treatment, according to several treatment providers,  particularly  if they  have been smoking for a year or more."
E0			SUMMARY
E0			Methamphetamine abuse is a continuing problem in these Western states and in Hawaii. While the drug has been used in these States for many years by a small number of users, it has gradually become the drug of choice and primary drug of abuse at entry to treatment in many areas, even overtaking the more common drug problems of heroin and cocaine in treatment populations. Even in areas where alcohol is cited as the most common treatment problem, methamphetamine is often the companion drug, along with marijuana, in anywhere from 25 to 80 percent of the cases.
E0			"Methamphetamine is a drug with particular appeal to students and  to blue collar workers, using it for recreation, to increase job or school performance, or simply to stay energized for long periods of time.  It is cheaper and  more accessible  than cocaine and appears  not to have the same stigma associated with  it.  As one ethnographer comments,  ""These users are too young  to remember  the 'Speed Kills' campaigns of the late 60s and early 70s, and  seem  to think  it is pretty  harmless.""  It can be injected, snorted,  smoked or even eaten,  making  it more versatile drug to administer.   However, it  is also a drug which has high burnout potential. Treatment providers in all States report users enter treatment more rapidly with methamphetamine than with either heroin or cocaine."
E0			One particularly interesting finding from these surveys is the uniformity of response in terms of why users decide to enter treatment. Over 50 percent of providers in each State cited legal problems as  the catalyst for most of their methamphetamine clients' entry into treatment. These legal problems are described as aggressive behaviors like fighting or  bizarre or inappropriate  behaviors which prompt others to call  the police.  Police sources also note that arrestees  under  the influence of methamphetamine are some of the most difficult to manage due to high levels of hostility, paranoia and agitation.
E0			This report also finds that methamphetarnine is readily available in these six States. It is both locally manufactured by small producers operating in a variety of places and using recipes widely circulated in the drug culture and, increasingly (on the U.S. mainland), manufactured  and distributed by Mexican nationals through local networks already established in the distribution of other drugs. This more efficient routing may be in part responsible for its increased popularity. in many areas.

E0			Pulse Check Methodology
E0			Since its first publication in 1992, the Pulse Check  has provided  the  most  current  intelligence about drug markets and patterns of drug abuse nation-wide. The Pulse Check draws on discussions with ethnographers and epidemiologists working in the drug field, law enforcement agents, and drug treatment providers across the country. Approximately  seventy-five people are called for each report.
E0			Ethnographers, Epidemiologists, and other Ethnographic Sources
E0			"Ethnography is a mode ofresearch that analyzes the behavior of groups in the natural settings in which these behaviors occur. Ethnographers use field observations and interviews to gather data. Ethnography is not undercover work. Rather, the ethnographer, who is fully revealed as a social science researcher, enters the drug user's world to record and describe it ""on its own terms,"" that is, without predetermined ideas."
E0			Epidemiologists are also consulted for the Pulse Check. Epidemiologists study the origins, spread, and control of diseases, in a general public health paradigm. In the field of substance abuse, they track changes in patterns of drug use, including the incidence and prevalence of the use of specific drugs, characteristics of users, and emerging trends. Many epidemiologists who report for the Pulse Check are members of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Community Epidemiology Working Group (CEWG).
E0			 Other ethnographers, such as sociologists and psychologists who use ethnographic research techniques, also are included as sources for the Pulse Check.
E0			 The ethnographic sources contacted by Pulse Check include some of the best known drug researchers in the country. In some cases, they are trained ethnographers; in other cases, they are epidemiologists with access to ethnographic information; a few are social researchers working in a field site collecting ethnographic data. Reporters are generally the same for each round of calls.
E0			The following twelve ethnographers, epidemiologists, and other ethnographic sources from urban areas were contacted for this issue of Pulse Check:

E0			Police Sources
E0			Police sources are drawn from the Abt staffs existing contacts within law enforcement and from contacts developed through the recommendations of law enforcement agencies. These sources are typically officers working on special squads, narcotics task forces, and DEA agents.
E0			This issue of Pulse Check reached police sources in six cities. Reporters are generally the same for each round of calls; however, when police contacts must change as officers take on new positions, replacements are typically made on the recommendation of the officer who had been the Pulse Check reporter.
E0			. Treatment Providers
E0			 The sample of treatment providers is derived from the National Facility Register, a directory of treatment programs compiled by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration, from which this sample from the Uniform Facility Data Set (formerly the
E0			 National Drug Abuse Treatment Unit Survey) is drawn within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.    The listings are divided  into four regions that  have a similar  number of treatment programs and are treated  equally  for sampling.  The states in each  region  are listed below.
E0			        ◦ Regio11 I: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Vennont, Pennsylvania
E0			        ◦ Region II: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, Washington, D.C., West Virginia
E0			        ◦ Region Ill: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Wisconsin, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota
E0			        ◦ Region IV: Colorado, Montana, Utah, Wyoming, Nevada, Arizona, California, Idaho, New Mexico, Washington, Oregon
E0			This Pulse Check incorporates the comments of 61 treatment providers. From each of the four regions listed above, 20 large (over 100 clients) programs and 20 small (under 100 clients) programs were identified, 10 to 15 of each type were contacted, and the remaining 5 served as replacements. The samples are stratified to include equal numbers oflarge and small programs.

E0			National Methamphetamine Strategy Update May 1997 CLINTON LIBRARY PHOTOCOPY
E0			Message to the President
E0			One year ago, in Miami, you announced our new methamphetamine strategy. It encompasses a tough but fair and balanced approach to this national problem. Those who violate the law must be caught and punished, while we must do all that we can to prevent the manufacture and trafficking of this poison.
E0			We are already beginning to see results. We are beginning to turn the corner.   Methamphetamine use_ is down in almost all cities where it is sampled. But, we must not let up. First, we must prevent the further spread of this scourge and second, we must continue to work until we have eliminated the problem.
E0			 While we are making this report to you, we are only doing so as representatives of men and women in federal, state, county and local government and the private sector. They have done the work and they deserve the credit.
E0			Janet Reno Attorney General Barry Mccaffrey Director, Office of National Drug Control Policy
E0			NATIONAL METHAMPHETAMINE STRATEGY UPDATE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY.
E0			Methamphetamine: The Challenge.
E0			Methamphetamine is a synthetic stimulant drug thal is cheaper than cocaine in many markets. produces a longer high than cocaine, and can produce extreme aggressiveness and irrational violence.
E0			"Methamphetamine use is spreading. Use of the drug  has  hislorically  been concentrated  in the West and Southwest. It is now spreading to the Midwest and to e East. Left unchecked, methamphewn.ine could become the ''crack"" cocaine of the 1990s, with even more devastating results."
E0			 Metbamphetamine production carries senre environmental risks. Methamphetamine is produced in clandestine laboratories, which carry an enonnously high risk of fire and explosion. The product.ion process creates large amounts of extremely toxic waste, much of which is dumped into waterways or on the ground. Officers investigating laboratories have been overwhelmed by chemicals, and the cost of cleaning up a single laboratory is often in the thousands of dollars.
E0			    I. The Administration S Response.
E0			 National Methamphetamine Strategy. The President's National Methamphetamine Stralegy addresses the emerging methamphetamine threat and provides the underpinnings for a coordinated govcmment wide response.
E0			 Legislation. With the Administration·s leadership. Congress enacted the Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996 last October. The Act strengthens criminal penalties for methamphetamine trafficking and establishes new controls over precursor chemicals.
E0			 Law Enforcement. The Administration has stepped up its effons to help law enforcement deal with methamphetamine trafficking, specifically:
E0			 By enhancing the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF) effon;
E0			 By designating a Midwest High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) to meet the methamphetamine threat in Nebraska, Iowa. Kansas, Missouri, and South Dakota:
E0			 By requesting that all U.S. Attorneys submit district plans assessing the current 1hreat and establishing coordination groups among community agencies, which was completed as of September 1996; and
E0			 By successfully investigating and prosecuting numerous criminal methamphetamine cases, in close coordination with the slate and local law enforcement agencies.
E0			 Improving Intelligence  Products and  Information  Sharing.  The Administration is reviewing the way intelligence and information is acquired, processed, and utilized in regard to the production, transportation, and sale of precursor chemicals, the manufacture, import.alien, and distribution of methamphetamine, and the laundering of profi derived from methamphetamine sales.
E0			 Prevention and Education. The Department of Education is developing material related to the prevention of methamphetamine use and will send the material  to all local education. agencies by September 30, I997.
E0			 TrealmenL Currently used psychosocial and cognitive-behavioral drug abuse treatment approaches are effective in reducing methamphetamine abuse. Research on drug abuse pharmacotherapies, as well as behavioral treatments, is continuing.
E0			 Data Collection. The National Institute of Justice's Dr11g Use Forecasting Report is adding substantial data to its banks of information on methamphetaminc abuse. In addition. NIJ is sponsoring research on methamphetam..ine distribution and market patterns in five western cities. The National Institutes of Health are also conducting an in-depth study of the methamphetaminc user. Preliminary findings from this study will be shared at an upcoming national mcthamphetamine conference.
E0			 Conferences. The Administration has hosted  two methamphetamine conferences  -  one regional and one national in scope - which drew more than 450 people representing a broad array of disciplines from all over the country. These conferences are the primary forums for sharing information. increasing understanding. coordinating effons. and soliciting input to improve the nation's response to the methamphetarnine problem.
E0			 Publications. The Office of National Drug Control Policy published two documents in January 1997 on methamphetamine - Pulse Check: Metlw.mphetamine Trends in Five Western States and Hawaii and Rticent DAWN Data on Methamphetamine and Speed.
E0			 Putting the Issue before the American People. The Administration has highlighled  the nature of the methamphetamine threat through public announcements. policy statements, media events, and meetings with coalitions at all levels of American society, and we plan to continue to do so in a varie1y of ways, including a proposed $175 million national advenising campaign.
E0			 Strategy Review. The Administration is continually reviewing and C\'alualing the effectiveness of the Kational Me1hamphetamine Strategy. Building upon its foundation. the 1998 National Drug Control Strategy will incorporate budget entries to update the action items of the National Methamphetamine Strategy.
E0			 REPORT ON METHAMPHETAMINE ABUSE AND TRAFFICKING IN THE UNITED STATES: An Update of the National Methamphetamine Strategy
E0			 Introduction.
E0			"The trafficking and abuse of methamphetamine - a highly destructive. addictive. and violence­ ausing synthetic drug - continues to be a national problem. Melhamphetamine. also known on the ireet as ..crystal ,"" ""crank."" ""ice ,"" and ""speed ,"" is a dangerous synthetic stimulant !hat results in an ddiction cycle and physiological trauma similar 10 that associated ""''ilh ""crack"" cocaine use. ,1ethamphetarnine may be injected. smoked, snorted, or ingested orally, making it increasingly attrac­ ive to casual usei, ."
E0			l. Historical Background.
E0			Until the early 1990s. methampheiamine trafficking was largely associated with motorcycle gangs who supplied users in various pans of the United States . A,·ailable data show that in the last few year.;, 1buse has risen significantly in the West and Southwest portions of the country. The Drug Use Forecasting DUF) siatistics released by lhe National Institute of Justice (NU) in July 1996 confirmed that rnethamphei:a• nine use was highest in western locales. According to lhe Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN), between 1989 and 1995. the estimated number of nationu•ide emergency-room drug abuse episodes involving nelhampheiamine doubled, and between 1991 and 1994. the number ofmethamphetamine deaths  nearly ripled.
E0			 The metharnphetamine problem has been spreading into the Midwest and eastward into states such as !\rkansas. Georgia. and Florida. For example. between 199:? and 1996 , the Midwest region (Missouri. Iowa, Kansas. South Dakota, and Nebraska) saw a 300 percent increase in clandestine laboratory seizures, and in 1996 , the Drug Enforcemem Administrdtion (DEA) seized 236 clandestine methamphetamine labo­ ratories in Missou ri alon e.
E0			 Unlike the cocaine busines s where Mexican traffickers are forced 10 rely upon their Colombian counter­ pans as primary suppliers . the Me ican organizations need  not depend  upon  ouiside sources 10  manufac­ ture methamphctamine . One the  precursor c hemicals  are obtained.  Me ican  organiza tions control  a.II links of the production. transportation. and distribution chains -  and lherc fore,  unfonunatdy.  gain  vinu  al• ly all of the illicit profits . The Mexican organizations that dominate wholesale methamphei:amine tr.1iiick­ ing arc capabk of producing unprecedented quantities of high-purity mcthamphcumunc in large-scale labo• ratorlcs .
E0			 Melhamphetamine also poses a unique public health and environmental hazard because of the na1Ure of ; manufacturing process. The toxic  propenies  associated  with  chemicals  in  and  around  me1hampheta­ ine laboratories introduce special health risks 10 law enforcement agents and the neighboring public: the .cendiary and ell plosive nature of these chemicals funher adds to the public safety ris ks. The se hazards 1d challenges warrant special precautions and training.
E0			  '. The Adminislralion's Response.
E0			 As a result of this growing methamphetamine threat. in February 1996, the Ad minis tration organized nd coortlinated a National Methamphetamine Conference in Arlington. Virginia to raise the public aware­ ess of the increasing problem. Over 200 representatives from feder al. slate , and local law enforcement gencies nationwide panicipated in the Confe rence, and for three days, ellpens shared their experiences. uccesses. and setbacks in their fight against methamphctaminc abuse and trafficking .
E0			 In response to the methamphetamine threat, the President released the National Methamphetamine ,trategy (the Strategy) in April 1996 . The Strategy assesses the methamphetamine threat, identifies the ssues, and draws an action plan to aven the spread of methamphewnine, which, if unchecked, could reach :pidcmic proponions .
E0			 The Strategy incorporates the recommendations from a broad spectrum of the law enforcement commu- 1ity. It also recognizes that in order lo tackle the methamphctamine and precursor chemicals proble m, the 3ovemment must adopt a multi-disciplinary approach, including legislation, law enforcement, training. :hemical regulation, international cooperation, environmental protection, education. and treatment. fherefore, the Strategy called upon the collective wealth of ellperience and ellpenise of the Depanments of Defense, Education . Health and Human Services_, J ustice. State, Treasury. the Environmental Protection Agency, the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), and other noted npens and scholars.
E0			 II. The Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996.
E0			 Based upon the Administration's initiative . Congress took an imponant s1ep when ii enac1ed the Comprehensive Methamphe1aminc Control Act of 1996 (the Ac1), which wa s signed into law on October 3, 1996 . The Act incorpora1es many elements that had been suggesled in lhe Na1ional Me1hamphetamme Strategy, including increased penalties and regulatory provisions for precursor chemicals.
E0			 Specifically, the Act directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to increase penalties for traffick.ing in methamphetam.ine and precursor chemicals to reflect the nature of such offenses . their relati, ·c  harm  to society. and the need for aggressive law enforcement action. It also requests 1hat the Com miss ion consida significant penalty enhancements for laboratory operators who mishandle ignita ble. corro sive. reac1i ve. and toxic chemicals so as to pose a risk 10 public safet y and the environment.
E0			 In late April 1997. the Commission adopted amendments (I) to increase the basic penalties for mctham ­ phetamine traffick.ing in cenain cases: (2) to provide an enhancemen1 for the imponation of methamphet3· mine or the manufacture of methamphetaminc from unlawfully impon ed che mica ls: and (3) to enhance penalties for the unlawful discharge. emission. or relca.,e of a hazardous or !Ollie substance or the unlawful transponalion, 1reatmem. storage . or disposal of a hazardous wa. te. These amendments to the Sentencing 4 Guidelines will take effect on November I, 19 97, unless an act of Congress  provides otherwise.  Earlier  in the year. the Commission had adopted emergency guideline amendments to increase  pcnalties for traffick­ ing in methamphet.amine precursor chemicals.
E0			 The Act also includes tighter controls on retail sales of drug products containing key precursor chemi­ cals: ephedrine, pseudoephedrinc or phenylpropanolamine . Because methamphetamine must be synthe­ sized from precursor chemicals, regulatory comrol of a select group of chemicals can impede clandestine domestic production of the drug.
E0			 Ill. Methamphetamine: A Top Law Enforcement Priority.
E0			 The Administration continues to place methamphet.amine e forcement efforts as a top priority. We must continue our cooperative partnerships among federal, state, and local agencies and  organizations.  There should be continued frank and candid conversations to discuss openly  the difficulties faced  by ea.ch  region of the country.
E0			 In 1996, at the request of the Attorney General. each U.S. Auomey assessed the m,:thamphetamine problem in her/his district and together with the federal, state, and local agencies. came up with a plan 10 address the problem. In some cases - particularly. in the Midwest and California - the U.S. Anomeys developed regional s trategies .
E0			 In addition, law enforcement agencies continue to develop intelligence and information on trafficking organizations and clandestine laboratories to assist in the  monitoring  of shipments of  methamphetamine and its precursor chemicals - with a special emphasis on major violent methamphetamine trafficking orga­ nizations.  Based  upon this information,  federal, state . and local law enforcemem  agencies are selecting and pursuing the highest-level and most dangerous targets.
E0			 The Administration is also addressing public safety issues connected with the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine . The environmental dangers presented by manufacturers of methamphetamine and the explosive potentialities pose significant hazards to private citizens and law enforcement personnd.
E0			 A sad example of the dangers of methamphetamine production  occurred  in  Perris. California  on  April 19, 1997, when a fire exploded in a trailer home seriously burning two young children, ages 4 and 6. The investigators determined  that  the fire \I/as most likely caused by the mo1her of the two children. auempting to ex1ract pseudoephedrine from certain phannaceutical tablets. The mother was subsequently arrested and charged with m:inufacturing m.:thamphetamirn: and  four counts of child  endangerment, and  more  than 1,400 bottles of pseudoephedrine were s.:ized by law enforcement authorities from the scene.
E0			 In Dec.:mber 1995 . a similar incidem occurred in which Kathy James watched as her three children - Dion (3 years). Jackson (2 years) and Megan (I years) - perished in an explosion and fire at an illicit methamphetamine laboratory in Aguanga, California.  The family's  mobile  hom.: \\'as demolished  as a result of the activities of Kathy James and two males, Harry Jensen and Michael Tulh.:rt. operating a clan­ destine methamphetamine laboratory. The three adults \I/ere hospitalized for bums and smoke inhalation, :ind traces of methamphetamine were found in the mother' s bloodstre.im. Kathy James was subsequently charged withsecond-degree murder :ind  manufacture  of a controlled  substance, and Jensen and Talben were charged with manufacturing a controlled substance and conspiracy.
E0			 In the same month, a methampheiamine laboratory using propane iuel caused $3.5 million worth of property damage to a motel near Bums . Oregon. The fire quickly spread to the walls and roof of the adjoining four-building complex. and all 122 rOOIT15 of the motel were destroyed. Fortunately , no guests were injured in the mishap: however. it could have been much worse since the motel was located directly across the s!It:et from Bum s High School.
E0			 These types of dangers must be addressed - not only by law enforcement authorities - but also in cooperation with public health and safety officials.
E0			    A. Drug Enforcemenl Administration lniJialives.
E0			 The DEA. in panicular, has demonstrated its commitment to combat the spread of methamphetamine uafficking and abuse by undertaking significant law enforcement and educational effo rts . DEA Clandestine Laboratory Enforcement Teams seiz.ed 879 clandestine methamphetamine laboratories - a 170 percent increase over the number of laboratories seized (326) in 1995. Current projections indicate that an even higher number of seizures will be achieved in 19'

E0			" In addition, the Special Operations Division run by DEA. Federal Bureau of ln""es1igation (FBI). and U.S. Customs Service (USCS), since April 1996, has funded or assisted in approximately 80 major metham­ phetamine investigations of Mexican targelS. Many of these investigations involve the use of extensive coun-authorized electronic survei llance and ocher sophisticaced invest igative techniques."
E0			 DEA has also provided subs1antial suppon 10 slate and  local  law enforcemenl  agencies  in combaning the distribution of me1hamphe1amine on our streets. DEA. in response to a request  by a county  sheriff. placed lhe Mobile Enforcement Terun in a rural Nebrask.a community to focus exclusively on mc1hamphc1- amine investigations. The  DEA Domestic  Operations Section  also instituted  a Special  Enforcement Program entitled Operation VELOCITY which target5 major methamphetarnine organizations. as well as independenl traffickers in the United Stales . The DEA Office of Diversion Control iniliated a priority lar· geting system named Operation BACKTRACK which 1arge1S rogue chemical companies that supply clan­ destine metharnphetamine laboratories.
E0			 Also. DEA, in conjunction  with the California Bureau of Narcotics  Enforcement  (BNE). the Western State Intelligence Network. and the El Paso Intelligence Ce nter. continues to work 10 establish a National Clandestine Laboratory Data Base, which will assist all law enforcement agencies in metharnphetamine investigations and provide a national perspective on clandestine laborato ries, based upon input from all law enforcement agencies. DEA has formulated plans  to  purchase  new safety equipment, such as air monito rs. air purified respirators. laboratory trucks, fire-resistant clothing. and other tactical clothing  for DEA agents and state and local officers who raid clandestine laboratories .
E0			    B. U.S. Customs Sen>iu lnilialiYes.
E0			 In May 1988. USCS initiated Operation CHEMCON. whose objectives arc to identify shipments oi precursor and essential chemicals that originate from or transit  major chemical  pons  in  the  United  States and determine what ponion of these exported chemicals were being illegally di\'ened to clandes1ine labora­ tories. Since January 1996.  the  Clean  Air Act  has prohibited  the  production,  purchase. sale, impon. or expon of freon into or outside the United  States; freon  is emerging an  imporumt  solvent  in the  production of metharnphetamine.
E0			 USCS is developing an au1omated expon sys1em database for domestic and international 1racking of U.S. exp ons. including precursor chemical s. USCS is also developing a dmabase 10 tabulate arres1 and seizure statistics for illegal exponation of precursor chemicals.
E0			    C. Successful Prosecutions .
E0			". Uni1cd Stales AUorncys around the nation continue 10 ackno""..lcdge methamphe tamine as a growing threat. Numerous methamphetrunine cases have been investiga1eJ and prosecuted by federa.1 agencies in close coordination and cooperation with 1he stmc and local law enforcement agencies. Many other s have been pro ecuted by local District Auorney·s Offices 1hroughout 1he country."
E0			 The OCDETF program, administered by DOJ. is an inter-agency )au· enforcement program which tar­ gets the highest- level drug traffickers in the country. including methamphctaminc lraffid ;ers. The nine federal agencies panicipa1in g in the OCDETf program ac1 in concen with numerous s1a1e and local agen­ cics and have achieved unprecedented lc\'els of coopcra1ion and coordination .
E0			 In addi1ion, in J 996 , the Direc1or of ONDCP designaled a five-state region in 1hc Midwest  as  a  High ln1ensi1y  Drug  Trafficking  Area  (HIDTA).  This   HIDTA  will  address  1he  problem   of  methamphetamine use. production. and trafficking  in  Nebraska .  Iowa,  Kansas.  Missouri.  and  Soulh  Dako1a  and  is  chaired  by the U.S. Anomey for lhe District of Nebraska.
E0			 Of the many successful federal methamphelamine prosecutions. a few arc summarized helou·:
E0			        ◦ Life Semence Imposed On Convicted Methamphetamine Trafficker. On April 24, 1997, in 1he Eastern Districl ofWashing1on, a federal coun imposed a life sentence  upon  Bernard  Montgomery  who  had been convicted of charges relating to his  melhamphe1amine  manufacturing  and distribu1ion  operations in Oregon and Albena, Canada. Co,defendants Lloyd Buxton and Edwin  Dale  McCain  received sentences of 30-year prison 1erms. The convic1ions culminaled a seven-month joint investigation involving the DEA, Royal  Canadian  Mounled  Police,  Hamey  Counly  (Oregon) Sheriff's  Office, Oregon Suue Police, and I.Assen County (Califorrtia) Narcotics Task Force. z z :u::i
E0			    • Life Sentence For Convicted Methamphetamine Trafficker. On December 17, 1996, in 1he Eas1em District of Missouri, Brian Dierling was sen1enced to life imprisonmenl wi1hou1 the possibilily of parole. A co-defendant, Arthur Holt, received a 420-months sentence, while 1wo other co-defendanlS, Mark Perkins and Lewis Younger. each were senlenced 10 almosl 20 years in prison for conspiring to distribute methamphetarrtine. This OCDETF inves1iga1ion was lhe join1 effon of the DEA , U.S . Marshals Service. Nonheas1 Missouri  Drug Task Forc, e  Quincy (Illinois)  Police Depanment,  Illinois State Police. Missouri Highway Patrol, Wcsl Central Ulinois Task Force, Adair Coun1y (Missouri) Sheriffs Department, Pu1nam Counly Sheriff's Dcpanment, Adams Coumy (Illinois) Sheriff's Depanment. Iowa Highway Patrol, Missouri Stale Fire Marshal's Evidence Bureau, and Schuyler County (Missouri) Sheriff's Depanmenl.
E0			    • Drug Transporters Indicted Following Largest Methamphetamine Sei:.ure in the U.S. On November 12. 1996, 11 defendants were indicted in the District of New Mexico, following lhe February 1995 seizure of almost 700  pounds of  metharnphctamine and  200  pounds of  marijuana. Two of 1he defend ants, Hcc1or Barron-Ramirez and Chicho, are charged as principal adrrtinistralors of :1 con1inuing criminal enterprise, the drug kingpin statute thal is resen ·ed for 1he highest echelon of par­ ticipants wi1hin a drug 1rafficking organiza tion. The methamphe1aminc and mariju::ma . which origi­ nated in Juarez. Mexico, had been  packed  in10  molded  fiberglass eonlaincrs  and  loaded  inlo the trail­ er a1 a warehouse in El Paso. and was being transponed 10 Chicago. This OCDETF invesligation was conducted by agenlS of the DEA and U.S. Cus1om. Service, as pan of the Southwesl Border lni1iali \'e.
E0			    • Chemical 5,iles Company Owner Sente11ced for lllicir Sule of Mcrhamphctami11e Precursor Chemicals. On September 17. 1996 . in 1he'Wcs1em Districl of Texas. Hec1or Dominguez was sen- 1enced 10 a signific::m1 term of imprisonment for possessing with intent 10 distribute '.!5 kilograms oi phenylacelic acid, a precursor chemical used in the produc1ion oi methamphetamine. Domingu z. an 011..ner of a small chemical sales comp:my in El Pas,o was arrested as he al!emptcd 10 sell 1he pheny­ lacelic acid 10 a DEA inform::ml.
E0			    • Largest Methti.mphetamine Trafficking Organization in Sou.rhea.sum New Mexico Taken Down. On July 17, 1996. in 1he Dis1ric1 of New Mexico, 26 individuals were charged in a 28-counl indicunem alleging a conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine and related fireanns charges, as well as forfeiture allegations against three pieces of land valued at more than $8,000,000. The principal administrator of this organization and several of his family members were engaged in operating a continuing criminal enterprise. The organization, centered in Roswell, New Mexico, was responsible for transporting 500 pounds of methamphetamine from California to New Mexico. This OCDETF investigation was conducted by law enforcement agents from DEA, FBI, U.S. Marshals Service, New Mexico State Police, Roswell Police Department. and Artesia Police Department.
E0			    D. Joint Task Force and Working Group Efforts.
E0			. In accordance with the Administration's goals of maintaining an open dialogue on methamphetamine concerns, several work..ing groups and task forces have been established to share information and db,cuss pending issues. Following a California-wide methamphetamine strategy meeting sponsored by DEA and BNE in May 1996 in Sacramento, California, a work..ing group of local. state, and federal investigato and prosecutors (Precursor Committee) was established to improve strategy against and prosecution of rogue precur.;or chemical supplier.;. The working group has already produced an investigation strategy which has been used as a guide around the state and in national training effons. In addition. Lhe group, work..ing with DEA and BNE Headquarters, has spearheaded a number of policy changes within the agencies to increase the likelihood of success in precursor prosecu1ions.
E0			. ln addition, the Precursor Comrniuee. chaired by the U.S. Attorney for 1he Southern Distric1 of California, and with lhe panicip.ition of Lhe other U.S. Anorney's Offices throughout California, has gener­ ated a target list of 1he largest precursor violators. Currently. there are a number of muhi-disui.ct investiga­ tions against these violacors who are located both within and oulside of California. The Committee meets regularly to coordinate investigations and share intelligence information with state and local entities.
E0			. In coordination with DEA Headquaners, the Precursor Committee has also begun a campaign to have legitimate chain drug and warehouse stores voluntarily restrict the availability of products that can be diverted to manufacture methamphetamine. Beginning in February 1997, Wal-Man. the nation·s largest retail chain. announced that it would voluntarily limit sales of pseudoephedrine, phenylpropanolamine and ephedrine.
E0			. As pan of the Precursor Committee. a California Prosecutors Working Group has been fanned. consist­ ing of Assistant U.S. Attorneys (AUSAs) from the four California districts and deputies from selected District Anorneys and the Attorney General's Office around the state. This group has already generated a number of reference guides co assist investigators. In addition. they arc jointly researching and addressing key legal issues which affect precursor prosecutions. so that a common approach to various proof and search and seizure issues may be taken throughout the state.
E0			" The U.S. Attorney's Offices throughout the OCDETF Sou1hwes1 Region have each designated an experienced AUSA to panicipate in a·methamphetamine working group. These melh.amphet:::trnine contacts conduct monthly 1eleconferenccs to share information regarding methamphetamine trends in tht! districts and to coordinate ongoing in\'estigations of rorue chemical companies. The Southwest Border metham­ phe1amine contacts group aho generated a re[!""ional reference guide to be di uibuted co investigaiors and prosecutor.; throughout the Southwest and is nov, coordinating  training sessions in the same reg io n.  Th.: San Diego County Methamphetamine Strike Force, composed of community leaders from 70 federal. state , and local agencies from law enforceme nt, health services, state couns. and drug treatment centers. has developed an action plan in the areas of interdiction, prevention, intervention, and treatment."
E0			 DOJ has worked to launch the Methamphetamine lnteragency Task Force, to ex.amine the best ways to reduce demand of methamphetamine, as required by the Act. Thb Task Force  will  bring together cxpem from all over the country to design. impleme nt. and evaluate the education. prevention. and treatment prac­ tices and strategies of the Federal government with respect to methamphetamine and other synthetic stimu­ lants.
E0			    E. Training. >::­ :<: cc ::; ::; u
E0			The Administration believes that the unique sensitivities surrounding the methamphetamine probkm W31Tant special training and awareness. In addition. DOJ's Advocacy Institute and Office of Legal Education have developed and offered a course on methamphetamine prosecutions . This course covered the operations of methamphetarnine laboratory. distribution patterns of methamphetaminc, search and seizure issues, precur.;or chemicals regulations. pro-active investigations, and prosccutive strategies. Training sessions continue to be arranged by  the  U.S. Attorneys  from  the Southern  District of California and the District of Nebraska to coordinate and share techniques and lessons learned with prosecutors in the Midwest districts .
E0			In addition . DEA has nearly doubled the number of clandestin.: laboratory ceniftcation training schools offered to state and local law enforcement from seven in FY 1996 to 13 in FY 1997 and established tv.·o remote training sites in San Diego and Kansas City. These schools will pro\'ide training  for 520 local oiii­ cers this year.
E0			Funhermore, DEA is reviewing the possibility of providing additional chemical hazards training for law enforcement agents. especially in  light  of the toxic and  incendiary  risks involv ed.  For  instance, in  March 19 97. a DEA Special Agent in Blackbum. Missouri inhaled some dangerous acidic fumes in a raid on a clandestine methamphet.amine laboratory. The agent suffered some minor bums to the nostril area and was taken to the hospital for treatment.
E0			"DEA also has funded a 24-hour mc1hamphc1aminc telephone number in il5 San Diego Field Division 10 provide law enforcement. treatment. and preven ti,·e services 10 San  Diego County at no cost.  DEA ha, joined forces with organizations - such as the Partnership for a Drug Free Ame rica and other cnu ues rep­ resenting prevent ion, law enforcement. treatment, and medical professional s - to pro vi de infom1ation and lectures on substance abuse to communities throughout the United States. DEA's Operation VELOCITY is producing a \'idemape production to educate law enforcement offic.:rs on som<"" oi the. chemical hazards oi clandestine laboratory investigations  .  Clandestine  lahoratory  awareness  posters ar.:  heing distributed  to stat and local clandestine laboratory enforcement teams throughout the United States."
E0			    IV. International Efforts.
E0			 Mexico-based organizations are now lhe predominant force behind mc1hamphel.lmine and precursor chemicals rr.afficlc.ing. The Adminisl.J'ation has been advising and training our foreign counlerparts - particu­ larly in Mexico - on ways to curb methamphctamine r.rafficlcing. as well  as  precursor chemical  smuggling and diversion. Funher, the Administration has  been augmenting  the  role  of  the existing  U.S.-Mexico work.ing group on precursor chemicals. which  oversees the training  of Mexican officials  and the  mechanics  of the exchange of chemical information with Mexico .
E0			 Indeed, we are seeing some modest successes in  Mexico. In  1996 ,  Mexican  law enforcement  authori­ ties seized more than a ton of  precursor chemicals - an  unprecedented  action .  The  Mexican  Government has also promulgated regulations restricting the number of  pons  through  which  precursor chemicals  may enter their country. The DEA's Office of Diversion Control has established an  automated  process for noti­ fying the relevant Mexican authority of each impending U.S. expon of selected chemicals to Mexico .
E0			 DEA has also provided substantial training to Mexican law enforcement authorities. In January  1997. DEA provided a thrce•day I.J'aining program in Mexico City to the Mexican government officials who arc responsible for chemical diversion in\'estigations. In  December  I 996, the  DEA  Mexico  City Country Office similarly a three•day seminar on the conl.J'OI of precursor and essential chemicals . These seminars included courses on chemical identification, safety equipment, and raid planning, among other topics .
E0			    V. Demand Reduction Efforts.
E0			    A. Educa..rion and Pre•ention.
E0			The Administration continues to stress the need for public awareness with respect to the methamphcta­ mine threat. All segments of our society - including law enforcement, teachers, judges. social workers . and public health officials - should learn about the hazards posed by this drug and should proclaim its dangers to America's youth.
E0			Two mcthamphetaminc conferences have been scheduled to assess progress and solicit input from the State s for revision of the National Methamphctamine Strategy. The first, a western regional conferen.:e. was held on January 12-13, 1997 in San Francisco, California . This Conference was co-hosted by Senator Feinstein and ONDCP, and 0\'er 160 persons participated from six states. The second Conference will take place on May 28-30, 1997 in Omaha. Nebraska and will be co•hosted by Senator Kcrrey and OJl:DCP.
E0			These Conferences bring together policy makers. researchers. public interest groups. law enforcement_ treatment . and pr.: \'ent ion specialists to share information, increase undemanding. and m.ike recommend3 - tions on improving the nation 's stracegic response to this growing problem . The Atto rney General. Director of ONDCP. DEA Administracor. Director of NIJ. and the Director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) will address the National Conference in Omaha . These Conferences build upon the Administration's efion lo educate the American public about the mechamphctaminc threat.
E0			CoUtction Of Data.
E0			 NIJ's DUF program has been so successful in gathering  imponant  drug  use data  and  information  that 1he Administration has decided to expand  the  program  more than  three  fold -  from  23 sites 10 75 sires - by fiscal year 2000. and i1 will be renamed Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM). ADAM will estab• lish a unique capacity lo collecl and  distribuie  reliable  data about ongoing  and emerging  drug use trends and crime patterns on a timely basis; it has received the s1rong suppon  from NIDA and  DEA.  ADAM  will be especially useful in developing effective national - as well as local - policies. and ii will institute an ou1reach program to gather additional  data from a targeted  population, ini1ia1e local coordinating councils to assist in the selection of outreach sites. and re•design data gathering methodology to reflect a broader population base and 10 better sample arrestee drug use and crime pauems .
E0			 The Administration's Operation Drug TEST is being implemented wi1h the Administrative Office of the United States Couns . Twenty.[ive federal dis1ricts have agreed to test arrestees for drug use - in most cases. prior to the arrestee·s li t appearance before a judicial officer. The Adminis1ra1ion hopes to expand thjs drug-testing. sanctions, and 1reatment program in an additional 25 districts in 1998.
E0			    B. Tuatmentfor Methamphetamine Abuse.
E0			Adminis1ration personnel are continuing 10 work with medical researchers and ueatmcnt practitioners to study whether there are  any  unique  behaviors of  methamphetamine abusers and special  measures that should be undenaken to restrain, but not funher injure, the user during arrest. Government officials have panicipated in public health conferences 10 determine the direction that medical  and scientific  research should take lo study the physical and chemical effects of methamphetamine, medical complications associ­ a1ed with its abuse. and 1Ieatmen1 and prevention methods.
E0			The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) held a conference in June 1996 10 study the sequelae of methamphe1amine abuse with implications for prevention , treatment. and research. The conforence included participants from the National Institutes of Heahh (l'-IH). DOJ. and ONDCP. a, well as a number of expens in lhe areas of research, treatment. and prevention.
E0			"NIDA held a conference entitled ""Methamphetamine:  Abuse , Treatment,  and  Preve ntion.""  on December 2·3. 1996 in San Francisco. This regional meeting brought together scientists. practitioners , and community leaders to discuss whal is known about merhamphet:unine abuse and addiction in the western United S tates and how to improve the response to this growing problem. The panicipanrs reviewed  the current state of epidemiology. basic research. prevention. consequences, and treatment. Additiona lly. KIDA continues to conduct research to dc,·elop specific treatment protocols, although research shov,.s that general psychosocia l and behavioral treatment effectively reduces drug use ."
E0			NIDA and other research has dramatically increased our knowledge ahout the neur.il basis ior psychus1imulam drugs (including melhamphetamine) and the neurotoxic psychostimulant methampheta• mine and related drugs. !\IDA currently suppons $20 million in research annually to understand the epi­ demiology of mcthamphetaminc use. its mechanism of action and effects ,10 brain iunctions. behavioral consequence s of mcthamphetarnine . anti ireatment anti prevention implications and approache s.
E0			With funding from SA.MHSA. a  group in somhern  California  has reponed 1hat  lhere is a measurable response of methamphetarnine users to psychosocial interventions, and  Lhat  the general  Lreatment  experience. as reflected by the auendance at therapeutic sessions. breaks in u-eatment panicipation, and total treatmcnl received, docs not differ significantly between methamphe1arnine and cocaine user...  A pilot  follow-up study  is in progress.
E0			Funhermore, SAMHSA  has a major proposals to investigate  the implications of  methamphetamine abuse.    It will evaluate the effects of methamphetamine on pregnancy and  post-natal development.  The  propo ed project will examine, retrospectively. the association of melha.mpheumine use during pregnancy  with the medical and developmental consequences found among two cohons of pre-natally metharnphetantine--exposed children born in 1989 and 1990.
E0			These effons are impon.ant because they will facilitate our understanding of how the behavior of methamphetarnine users may endanger themselves, others in the home or the immediate community, and Jaw enforcement  personnel.  Greater knowledge about  the characteristics of  melhampheumine users and  the ability to identify them is impon.ant because invesligative and prosecutive decisions may be affected if a defendant. .i witness. or an informant has a drug abuse problem.
E0			    VI. Successful Initial Data Regarding Administration's Efforts.
E0			 The Administration believes thal ilS vigorous effons have led to a moderation in the trend of methamphetamine Lrnffick.ing and abuse, based upon the same statistical criteria  previously  used.  The  preliminary  data from NIJ's 1996 Drug Use Forecasting figures show that in eight western cities (Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Omaha, Phoenix, Ponland, San Diego, and San Jose), methamphetamine use declined between 7 and 52.
E0			percent from 1995 figures. The only city that showed an increase in methamphe1amine use was San Antonio, which rose from 1.5 percent in 1995 to 2.1 percent  in  1996.  In the remaining  14 cities panicipating  m  the DUF program (Miami. Cleveland, New Orleans. Chicago. District of Columbia, Fl. Lauderdale, Detroit. 1anhattan. Birmingham, HouslOn. St. Loui . Indianapolis, Allanta, and Philadelphia). fewer than  I% of arres1ees 1es1ed positive for metha.mpetaminc. 1n keeping with trends of recent year . the 1996 DUF figures show tha1 adult femaJe arres1ees u  metharnphetamine mo  than male arrestees. and  white arres1ee!> coniin ucd to use ntcthamphetamine in greater percentages than African-American and Hispanic arrt!slees.
E0			National Institute of Justice Drug Use Forecasting 1995-1996 Comparison 1995 (%) 1996 (%) San Dieao 37.1 29.9 Phoenix 21.9 12.2 Portland, OR 18.7 12.4 San Jose 18.5 14.8 Omaha 8.1 4.3 LosAnneles 7.5 7.0 Denver 3.8 2.2 San Antonio 1.5 2.1
E0			 Nevertheless, our continued effons must remain vigilant and should be fonified. We must be cautious not to relax our vigorous efforts. because our goals and objectives have not yet been accomplished. We need to continue a comprehensive assaull against the dangers associao=d with methamphetamine produc­ tion. distribution, trafficking, and abuse.
E0			    VII. Increased Resources Requested.
E0			To demonstrate the Administration's continued effons to combat the methamphe1am.ine problem, it has requested additional resources be devoted to the threat.
E0			A significant portion of the methamphetamine trafficking is occurring along the Southwest border. As part of the Administration's Southwest Border Initiative (SWBI), many DOJ components received signifi­ cant resource enhancemems in fiscal year 1997. 'Ibe SWBI targets trafficking groups that manufacture and distribute methamphetamine as well as other drugs. In the Administration's fiscal year 1998 request, the U.S. Attorneys, DEA, and FBI are seeking a total of 3.59 positions (146 agenb and 41 attorneys) and S46.8 million as part of the SWBI.  Much of these resources will be used to assis1 in combatting the trafficking  of methamphetamine.
E0			The rise in methamphetamine trafficking has also caused an increased caseload for the U.S. Attorneys. and in response, the Administration's fiscal year 1998 request for U.S. Attorneys includes an enhancement of 56 positions (37 attorneys) and $5,161,000 for its Narcotic and Dangerous Drug program. In addition,  the Administration is seeking three additional DOJ Criminal Division attorney positions in fiscal year 1998 10 increase its ability to coordinate the SWBI from headquaners. These fX>Sitions will supfX)rt the Attorney General's goal to achieve enhanced centralized  management of the investigations and prosecutions related to the large-scale, multi-district methamphctamine ca-.cs. With respect lo DEA. the fiscal year 1998 budget rcques1 include:. an increase of7-i fX)Sitions t60 agents) and SI I. I million in resources IO fund a comprehensive approach to combat methamphetamine 1rafficking. The FBI is focusing on identifying the most significant Mexican manufactun:rs and distribu­ tors of methamphetamine and targeting 1hc command and control individuals of lhesc Or-£anizations. including key distribution networks in small and medium-sized U.S. cornmunilies. In addition, 1he FBI is focusing its resources on methamphetamine distribu1ion element!> located in problem areas, such a.s Omaha, Nebraska, St. Louis, Missouri, and Jackson, Tennessee.
E0			    VIII. Conclusion.
E0			 The Adminis1ration is dedicated to continuing its efforts to stop the spread of methamphetamine traf­ ficking and abuse in 1his country. Curbing the lide of methamphetamine from abroad. stemming its east­ ward march, and punishing those who traffic in this pernicious poison are all part of our effons. We are making a no1iceable difference, and methamphetamine usage is beginning to drop almosl everywhere in the country, as the Drug Use Forecasting numbers so vividly show.
E0			  While we are taking steps in the right direction, we cannol  become complacent.  We must remain strong  in our commitmenl to fight 1his  menace until  we have completely eliminated  it from sociely,  Life sen­ tences for major u-affickers are entirely appropriate. Companies which facilitate these crime!> must be pun­ ished as well.
E0			" We have begun to tum the tide on methamphetamine abuse and uafficking, and we must maintain our vigilance if we are to completely vanquish this threat. ""     • ""Idrugsumm.qa3 Page 1JI .,;.,.,u- 14, 'Eqwr"
